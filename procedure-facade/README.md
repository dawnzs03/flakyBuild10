# GDS Procedure layer

This directory hosts the user interface layer in the standard stack [citation needed]:

1) User interface
2) Applications
3) Domain
4) Integration

That is, here lives any code that supports integrating GDS with Neo4j Procedures.

Code in this layer will utilize, among other thing, code in [the GDS application layer](../applications/README.md).

This is also where we place the Neo4j Extension for the GDS Plugin.
