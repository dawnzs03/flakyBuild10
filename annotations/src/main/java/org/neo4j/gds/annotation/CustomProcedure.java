/**
 * This annotation can be used to annotate a procedure in the same way as using `@Procedure` would.
 * However, this annotation does not actually register anything with the procedure framework.
 * We can use it to provide as quasi-equivalent method for out documentation and test tooling
 * for procedures and functions that cannot use actual procedure framework annotations.
 * It can also be used to pretend that `@UserAggregationFunction`s have a `@Procedure` annotation.
 * <p>
 * The return type of the annotated method should be a proper Java interface, not a Map,
 * so that we can extract the schema from the fields.
 * Only fields marked with the nested `@CustomProcedure.ResultField` annotation are included in the schema.
 * <p>
 * The parameters of the annotated method should be annotated with `@Name` as you would for regular `@Procedure` methods.
