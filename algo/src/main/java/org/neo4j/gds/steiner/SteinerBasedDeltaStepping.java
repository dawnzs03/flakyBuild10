/*
 * the idea of this Delta-Stepping modification is to provide an efficient implementation to the following heuristic:
 *
 * while there exists a terminal for which a path form the source has not been found yet
 *              1. Find the shortest path in the current graph to any unvisited terminal
 *              2. Modify the graph such that all edges in the discovered path have weight equal to zero.
 *
 * We do implicit zeroing by keeping an array of vertices which are accessible from root with zero cost.
 * Also, when a path to terminal has been found, we do not start a shortest path search from scratch.
 * We instead continue from where we left off.
