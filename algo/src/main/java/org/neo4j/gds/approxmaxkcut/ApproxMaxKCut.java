/*
 * Implements a parallelized version of a GRASP (optionally with VNS) maximum k-cut approximation algorithm.
 *
 * A serial version of the algorithm with a slightly different construction phase is outlined in [1] as GRASP(+VNS) for
 * k = 2, and is known as FES02G(V) in [2] which benchmarks it against a lot of other algorithms, also for k = 2.
 *
 * TODO: Add the path-relinking heuristic for possibly slightly better results when running single-threaded (basically
 *  making the algorithm GRASP+VNS+PR in [1] and FES02GVP in [2]).
