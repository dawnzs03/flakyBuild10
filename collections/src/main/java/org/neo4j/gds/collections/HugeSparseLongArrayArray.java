 * A long-indexable version of an array of primitive long arrays ({@code

 * <p>
 * It is implemented by paging of smaller arrays where each array, a so-called
 * page, can store up to 4096 elements. Using small pages can lead to fewer
 * array allocations if the value distribution is sparse. For indices for which
 * no value has been inserted, a user-defined default value is returned.
 * <p>
 * The array is immutable and needs to be constructed using a thread-safe,
 * growing builder.
