  Authentication on the <code>/project</code> end-point allows separate authentication credentials for each Jenkins job.
  Separate credentials allow each Jenkins job to define their own token in the GitLab configuration section of the job definition.
  </p>

  The token generated in the Jenkins job needs to be pasted into the GitLab "Secret Token" field of the GitLab project webhook definition associated with that Jenkins job.
