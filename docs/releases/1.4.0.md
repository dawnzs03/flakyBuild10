# Datafaker 1.4.0 (20 May 2022)

Thanks to the hard work of Sergey Nuyanzin and a lot of contributors, I'm pleased to say we have another 
new release of Datafaker. Lots of things have improved in this relase, such as (as usual), a lot of new providers,
performance improvements in the generation of data, CSV and JSON generation through expressions, etc.

Internally, we've recently migrated from JUnit 4 to JUnit 5, and from Hamcrest to AssertJ. 
This is a slightly better approach to testing to making sure our library is without any errors.

**Fun fact**: at the moment, we have close to 30.000 tests, with a code coverage of around 93%. 
Despite having this amount of tests, all the tests run in less than 20 seconds!
