# Applications

This directory hosts the application layer in the standard stack [citation needed]:

1) User interface
2) Applications
3) Domain
4) Integration

In this context, stuff that goes here are user facing, actionable things that are not Neo4j specific. That's the very short description.

A longer one would be: look at graph drop.

1) A Neo4j procedure and a hook in the Procedure Facade
2) Catalog Business Facade delegating to the Native Graph Drop application
3) Graph Store Catalog Service and little domain bits like User and GraphName
4) We haven't got an example of that yet.
