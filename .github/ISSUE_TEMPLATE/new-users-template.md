### Instructions (remove the section below once you've read it!)

Welcome here, the Mutiny project values your feedback!

ðŸ’¡  First of all if you have a **question** rather than a _problem_ or a _feature idea_, then please post a new discussion at https://github.com/smallrye/smallrye-mutiny/discussions

ðŸ’¥  If you have found a bug then please provide a reproducer and as much context as possible (Java version, operating system, etc). It is even better if you can extract a minimal reproducer as a [JBang script](https://www.jbang.dev/) so we can easily check from our side.

âœ¨  If you have an idea for a new feature then please share relevant use-cases that would justify the addition(s). Same thing if you have an improvement idea: context is key!
