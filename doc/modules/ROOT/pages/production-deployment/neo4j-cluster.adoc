= GDS with Neo4j cluster
:description: This section describes how the Neo4j Graph Data Science library can be used in a Neo4j cluster deployment.


include::partial$/common-usage/not-on-aurads-note.adoc[]

It is possible to run GDS as part of Neo4j cluster deployment.
Since GDS performs large computations with the full resources of the system it is not suitable to run on instances that serve the transactional workload of the cluster.


== Deployment

[.tabbed-example, caption = ]
====

[.include-with-neo4j-5x]
=====

We make use of a _Secondary_ instance to deploy the GDS library and process analytical workloads.
Calls to GDS `write` procedures are internally directed via _server-side routing_ to the cluster instance that is a `Writer` for the database we work on.

Neo4j 5.x supports different databases on the same cluster instance to act as `Primary` or `Secondary` members of the cluster.
In order for GDS to function, all databases on the instance it is installed have to be `Secondary`, including the `system` database (see https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/reference/configuration-settings/#config_server.cluster.system_database_mode[server.cluster.system_database_mode] and https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/reference/configuration-settings/#config_initial.server.mode_constraint[initial.server.mode_constraint]).
GDS has compute-intensive OLAP workloads that may disrupt the cluster operations and we recommend GDS to be installed on an instance that is not serving transactional load and does not participate in `Leader` elections.

Please refer to the https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/clustering/setup/analytics-cluster/[official Neo4j documentation] for details on how to set up a Neo4j analytics cluster.
Note that the link points to the latest Neo4j version documentation and the configuration settings may differ from earlier versions.

* The cluster must contain at least one _Secondary_ machine
** single _Primary_ and a _Secondary_ is a valid scenario.
** GDS workloads are not load-balanced if there are more than one _Secondary_ instances.
* Cluster should be configured to use https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/clustering/internals/#clustering-routing[server-side routing].
* GDS plugin deployed on the _Secondary_.
** A valid GDS Enterprise Edition license must be installed and configured on the _Secondary_.
** The driver connection to operated GDS should be made using the `bolt://` protocol to the _Secondary_ instance.

[NOTE]
======
When working with cluster configuration you should beware https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/reference/configuration-settings/#config_server.config.strict_validation.enabled[strict config validation] in Neo4j.

When configuring GDS for a Secondary instance you will introduce GDS-specific configuration into `neo4j.conf` - and that is fine because with the GDS plugin installed, Neo4j will happily validate those configuration items.

However, you might not be able to reuse that same configuration file verbatim on the core cluster members, because there you will _not_ install GDS plugin, and thus Neo4j will _not_ be able to validate the GDS-specific configuration items. And validation failure would mean Neo4j would refuse to start.

It is of course also possible to turn strict validation off.

We make use of a _Read Replica_ instance to deploy the GDS library and process analytical workloads.
Calls to GDS `write` procedures are internally directed to the cluster `LEADER` instance via _server-side routing_.

Please refer to the https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/4.4/clustering/[official Neo4j documentation] for details on how to setup Neo4j Causal Cluster.
Note that the link points to the latest Neo4j 4.x version documentation and the configuration settings may differ from earlier versions.
======

* The cluster must contain at least one _Read Replica_ instance
** single _Core member_ and a _Read Replica_ is a valid scenario.
** GDS workloads are not load-balanced if there are more than one _Read Replica_ instances.
* Cluster should be configured to use https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/4.4/clustering/internals/#causal-clustering-routing[server-side routing].

** A valid GDS Enterprise Edition license must be installed and configured on the _Read Replica_.
** The driver connection to operated GDS should be made using the `bolt://` protocol, or _server-policy routed_ to the _Read Replica_ instance.

== GDS Configuration

The following optional settings can be used to control transaction size.

[opts="header"]
|===
| Property                  | Default
| `gds.cluster.tx.min.size` | 10000
| `gds.cluster.tx.max.size` | 100000
|===

The batch size for writing node properties is computed using both values along with the configured concurrency and total node count.
The batch size for writing relationship is using the lower value of the two settings.
There are some procedures that support batch size configuration which takes precedence if present in procedure call parameters.
