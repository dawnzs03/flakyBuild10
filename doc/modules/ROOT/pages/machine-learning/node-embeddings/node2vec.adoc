Node2Vec is a node embedding algorithm that computes a vector representation of a node based on random walks in the graph.
The neighborhood is sampled through random walks.
Using a number of random neighborhood samples, the algorithm trains a single hidden layer neural network.
The neural network is trained to predict the likelihood that a node will occur in a walk based on the occurrence of another node.

[[algorithms-embeddings-node2vec-random-walks]]
== Random Walks

A main concept of the Node2Vec algorithm are the second order random walks.
A random walk simulates a traversal of the graph in which the traversed relationships are chosen at random.
In a classic random walk, each relationship has the same, possibly weighted, probability of being picked.
This probability is not influenced by the previously visited nodes.
The concept of second order random walks, however, tries to model the transition probability based on the currently visited node `v`, the node `t` visited before the current one, and the node `x` which is the target of a candidate relationship.
Node2Vec random walks are thus influenced by two parameters: the `returnFactor` and the `inOutFactor`:

* The `returnFactor` is used if `t` equals `x`, i.e., the random walk returns to the previously visited node.
* The `inOutFactor` is used if the distance from `t` to `x` is equal to 2, i.e., the walk traverses further away from the node `t`

The probabilities for traversing a relationship during a random walk can be further influenced by specifying a `relationshipWeightProperty`.
A relationship property value greater than 1 will increase the likelihood of a relationship being traversed, a property value between 0 and 1 will decrease that probability.

For every node in the graph Node2Vec generates a series of random walks with the particular node as start node.
The number of random walks per node can be influenced by the `walkPerNode` configuration parameters, the walk length is controlled by the `walkLength` parameter.


== Usage in machine learning pipelines

At this time, using Node2Vec as a node property step in a machine learning pipeline (like xref:machine-learning/linkprediction-pipelines/link-prediction.adoc[] and xref:machine-learning/node-property-prediction/index.adoc[]) is _not_ well supported, at least if the end goal is to apply a prediction model using its embeddings.

In order for a machine learning model to be able to make useful predictions, it is important that features produced during prediction are of a similar distribution to the features produced during training of the model.
Moreover, node property steps (whether Node2Vec or not) added to a pipeline are executed both during training, and during the prediction by the trained model.
It is therefore problematic when a pipeline contains an embedding step which yields all too dissimilar embeddings during training and prediction.

The final embeddings produced by Node2Vec depends on the randomness in generating the initial node embedding vectors as well as the random walks taken in the computation.
At this time, Node2Vec will produce non-deterministic results even if the `randomSeed` configuration parameter is set.
So since embeddings will not be deterministic between runs, Node2Vec should not be used as a node property step in a pipeline at this time, unless the purpose is experimental and only the train mode is used.

It may still be useful to use Node2Vec node embeddings as features in a pipeline if they are produced outside the pipeline, as long as one is aware of the data leakage risks of not using the dataset split in the pipeline.
