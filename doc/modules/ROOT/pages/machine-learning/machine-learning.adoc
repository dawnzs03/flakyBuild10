:description: This chapter provides explanations and examples for the supervised machine learning in the Neo4j Graph Data Science library.

In GDS, our pipelines offer an end-to-end workflow, from feature extraction to training and applying machine learning models.
Pipelines can be inspected through the xref:pipeline-catalog/pipeline-catalog.adoc[Pipeline catalog].
The trained models can then be accessed via the xref:model-catalog/index.adoc[Model catalog] and used to make predictions about your graph.

To help with building the ML models, there are additional guides for pre-processing and hyperparameter tuning available in:

* xref:machine-learning/pre-processing/index.adoc[Pre-processing]
* xref:machine-learning/training-methods/index.adoc[Training methods]

The Neo4j GDS library includes the following pipelines to train and apply machine learning models, grouped by quality tier:

* Beta
** xref:machine-learning/node-property-prediction/nodeclassification-pipelines/node-classification.adoc[Node Classification Pipelines]
** xref:machine-learning/linkprediction-pipelines/link-prediction.adoc[Link Prediction Pipelines]

* Alpha
