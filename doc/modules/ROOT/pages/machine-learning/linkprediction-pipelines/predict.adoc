include::partial$/operations-reference/beta-note.adoc[]


In the previous sections we have seen how to build up a Link Prediction training pipeline and train it to produce a predictive model.
After xref:machine-learning/linkprediction-pipelines/training.adoc[training], the runnable model is of type `{modelType}` and resides in the xref:model-catalog/index.adoc[model catalog].

The trained model can then be applied to a graph in the graph catalog to create a new relationship type containing the predicted links.
The relationships also have a property which stores the predicted probability of the link, which can be seen as a relative measure of the model's prediction confidence.

Since the model has been trained on features which are created using the feature pipeline, the same feature pipeline is stored within the model and executed at prediction time.
As during training, intermediate node properties created by the node property steps in the feature pipeline are transient and not visible after execution.

When using the model for prediction, relationships in the input graph are separated according to the configuration.
By default, the configuration will be the same as the configuration used for training the pipeline.
Relationships marked as context relationships during training are again used for computing features in node property steps.
The target relationship type is used to prevent predicting already existing relationships.
This configuration may be overridden to specify a different context, or different set of relationships to exclude from prediction.

It is necessary that the predict graph contains the properties that the pipeline requires and that the used array properties have the same dimensions as in the train graph.
If the predict and train graphs are distinct, it is also beneficial that they have similar origins and semantics, so that the model is able to generalize well.

== Search strategies

To find the best possible new links, GDS offers two different search strategies.

[[algorithms-link-prediction-pipelines-predict-exhaustive-search]]
=== Exhaustive Search

The exhaustive search will simply run through all possible new links, that is, check all node pairs that are not already connected by a relationship.
For each such node pair the trained model is used to predict whether they should be connected by a link or not.
The exhaustive search will find all the best links, but has a potentially long runtime.

[[algorithms-link-prediction-pipelines-predict-approximate-search]]
=== Approximate Search

To avoid possibly having to run for a very long time considering all possible new links (due to the inherent quadratic complexity over node count), GDS offers an approximate search strategy.

The approximate search strategy lets us leverage the xref:algorithms/knn.adoc[K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm] with our model's prediction function as its similarity measure to trade off lower runtime for accuracy.
Accuracy in this context refers to how close the result is to the very best new possible links according to our models predictions, i.e. the best predictions that would be made by exhaustive search.

The initial set of considered links for each node is picked at random and then refined in multiple iterations based of previously predicted links.
See the xref:algorithms/knn.adoc[K-Nearest Neighbors documentation] for more details on how the search works.

[[algorithms-link-prediction-pipelines-predict-examples]]
== Example

In this example we will show how to use a trained model to predict new relationships in your projected graph.
In order to do this, we must first have an already trained model registered in the Model Catalog.
We will use the model which we trained in the xref:machine-learning/linkprediction-pipelines/training.adoc#linkprediction-pipeline-examples-train-query[train example] which we gave the name `lp-pipeline-model`.
The algorithm excludes predictions for existing relationships in the graph as well as self-loops.

There are two different strategies for choosing which node pairs to consider when predicting new links, exhaustive search and approximate search.
Whereas the former considers all possible new links, the latter will use a randomized strategy that only considers a subset of them in order to run faster.
We will explain each individually with examples in the xref:machine-learning/linkprediction-pipelines/predict.adoc#algorithms-link-prediction-pipelines-predict-examples-mutate[mutate examples] below.

[NOTE]
====
The relationships that are produced by the write and mutate procedures are undirected, just like the input.
However, no parallel relationships are produced.
So for example if when doing approximate search, `a -- b` are among the top predictions for `a`, and `b -- a` are among the top predictions for `b`, then there will still only be one undirected relationship `a -- b` produced.
The stream procedure will yield a node pair only once.

})
 YIELD node1, node2, probability
 RETURN gds.util.asNode(node1).name AS person1, gds.util.asNode(node2).name AS person2, probability
 ORDER BY probability DESC, person1
----

We specify `threshold` to include only predictions with probability greater than 50%, and `topN` to further limit output to the top 5 relationships.
As the default samplingRate is `1`, we use the xref:machine-learning/linkprediction-pipelines/predict.adoc#algorithms-link-prediction-pipelines-predict-exhaustive-search[exhaustive-search].

.Results

| "Alice"    | "Greg" | 0.541626603910584
|===

We can see that the model thinks that the above pairs should be connected.
Other node pairs have a lower probability and are filtered out of the result.

[[algorithms-link-prediction-pipelines-predict-examples-mutate]]
=== Mutate

In this example we will show how to write the predictions to your projected graph.
We will use the model `lp-pipeline-model`, that we trained in the xref:machine-learning/linkprediction-pipelines/training.adoc[train example].

[role=query-example, group=lp]
--
[source, cypher]
----
CALL gds.beta.pipeline.linkPrediction.predict.mutate('myGraph', {
  modelName: 'lp-pipeline-model',
  relationshipTypes: ['KNOWS'],
  mutateRelationshipType: 'KNOWS_EXHAUSTIVE_PREDICTED',
  topN: 5,
  threshold: 0.5
}) YIELD relationshipsWritten, samplingStats
----

We specify `threshold` to include only predictions with probability greater than 50%, and `topN` to further limit output to the top 5 relationships.
As the default samplingRate is `1`, we use the xref:machine-learning/linkprediction-pipelines/predict.adoc#algorithms-link-prediction-pipelines-predict-exhaustive-search[exhaustive-search].
Because we are using the `UNDIRECTED` orientation, we will write twice as many relationships to the in-memory graph.

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| relationshipsWritten | samplingStats
| 10                    | {linksConsidered=16, strategy=exhaustive}
|===
--

As we can see in the `samplingStats`, we used the exhaustive search strategy and checked 16 possible links during the prediction.
Indeed, since there are a total of `8 * (8 - 1) / 2 = 28` possible links in the graph and we already have 12, that means we check all possible new links.
Although 16 links were considered, we only mutate the best five (since `topN = 5`) that are above our threshold, and in fact only one link did pass the threshold (see <<algorithms-link-prediction-pipelines-predict-examples-stream>>).

If our graph is very large there may be a lot of possible new links.
As such it may take a very long time to run the predictions.
It may therefore be a more viable option to use a search strategy that only looks at a subset of all possible new links.


[[algorithms-link-prediction-pipelines-predict-examples-approximate]]
=== Approximate search

To avoid possibly having to run for a very long time considering all possible new links, we can use the xref:machine-learning/linkprediction-pipelines/predict.adoc#algorithms-link-prediction-pipelines-predict-approximate-search[approximate search strategy].

[role=query-example, group=lp]
--
[source, cypher]
----
CALL gds.beta.pipeline.linkPrediction.predict.mutate('myGraph', {
  modelName: 'lp-pipeline-model',
  relationshipTypes: ['KNOWS'],
  mutateRelationshipType: 'KNOWS_APPROX_PREDICTED',
  sampleRate: 0.5,
  topK: 1,
  randomJoins: 2,
  maxIterations: 3,
  // necessary for deterministic results
  concurrency: 1,
  randomSeed: 42
})
 YIELD relationshipsWritten, samplingStats
----

In order to use the approximate strategy we make sure to set the `sampleRate` explicitly to a value `< 1.0`.
For this small example, we limit the search by setting the `maxIterations` to `3` and `randomJoins` to `2` .
Also, we set `topK = 1` to get one predicted link for each node.
Because we are using the `UNDIRECTED` orientation, we will write twice as many relationships to the in-memory graph.

.Results
[opts="header",cols="3,7"]
|===
| relationshipsWritten | samplingStats
| 16                   | {didConverge=true, linksConsidered=48, ranIterations=2, strategy=approximate}
|===
--

As we can see in the `samplingStats`, we use the approximate search strategy and check 48 possible links during the prediction.
Though in this small example we actually consider more links that in the exhaustive case, this will typically not be the case for larger graphs.
Since the relationships we write are undirected, reported `relationshipsWritten` is 16 when we search for the best (`topK = 1`) prediction for each node.



[[algorithms-link-prediction-pipelines-predict-examples-filtered]]
=== Predict with context filtering

In xref:machine-learning/linkprediction-pipelines/training.adoc#linkprediction-pipeline-examples-train-filtering[Training with context filters], we trained another model `lp-pipeline-model-filtered` on `fullGraph` which uses context `City` nodes and context `LIVES` and `BORN` relationships.

We can leverage this model in prediction, optionally overriding node label or relationship type filter configuration in prediction.
In this case we do not, and instead inherit the filtering configuration from the train configuration of the `lp-pipeline-model-filtering` model.
In other words, we predict Person-KNOWS-Person relationships, additionally using `City` nodes and `LIVES` and `BORN` relationships for the node property steps.

[role=query-example, group=lp]

[source, cypher]
----
CALL gds.beta.pipeline.linkPrediction.predict.stream('fullGraph', {
  modelName: 'lp-pipeline-model-filtered',
  topN: 5,
  threshold: 0.5
})
 YIELD node1, node2, probability
 RETURN gds.util.asNode(node1).name AS person1, gds.util.asNode(node2).name AS person2, probability
 ORDER BY probability DESC, person1
----

We specify `threshold` to include only predictions with probability greater than 50%, and `topN` to further limit output to the top 5 relationships.
As the default samplingRate is `1`, we use the xref:machine-learning/linkprediction-pipelines/predict.adoc#algorithms-link-prediction-pipelines-predict-exhaustive-search[exhaustive-search].

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| person1   | person2   | probability
| "Alice"    | "Chris" | 0.761499973561355
| "Chris"    | "Mark" | 0.698029761673014
| "Alice"    | "Mark" | 0.592463039575708
| "Alice"    | "Karin" | 0.573335167938716
| "Alice"    | "Greg" | 0.563686221461585
|===

We can see that our model predicts the same top 5 links as it did with the unfiltered model `lp-pipeline-model`.
However, the probabilities vary slightly, due to the additional context information used in training and prediction.
