[[algorithms-split-relationships-intro]]
== Introduction

The Split relationships algorithm is a utility algorithm that is used to pre-process a graph for model training.
It splits the relationships into a holdout set and a remaining set.
The holdout set is divided into two classes: positive, i.e., existing relationships, and negative, i.e., non-existing relationships.
The class is indicated by a `label` property on the relationships.
This enables the holdout set to be used for training or testing a machine learning model.
Both, the holdout and the remaining relationships are added to the projected graph.

If the configuration option `relationshipWeightProperty` is specified, then the corresponding relationship property is preserved on the remaining set of relationships.
Note however that the holdout set only has the `label` property; it is not possible to induce relationship weights on the holdout set as it also contains negative samples.

Consider the graph created by the following Cypher statement:

[source, cypher, role=noplay setup-query]
----
CREATE
    (n0:Label),
    (n1:Label),
    (n2:Label),
    (n3:Label),
    (n4:Label),
    (n5:Label),

    (n0)-[:TYPE { prop: 0} ]->(n1),
    (n1)-[:TYPE { prop: 1} ]->(n2),
    (n2)-[:TYPE { prop: 4} ]->(n3),
    (n3)-[:TYPE { prop: 9} ]->(n4),
    (n4)-[:TYPE { prop: 16} ]->(n5)
----

Given the above graph, we want to use 20% of the relationships as holdout set.
The holdout set will be split into two same-sized classes: positive and negative.
Positive relationships will be randomly selected from the existing relationships and marked with a property `label: 1`.
Negative relationships will be randomly generated, i.e., they do not exist in the input graph, and are marked with a property `label: 0`.

[source, cypher, role=noplay graph-project-query]
----
CALL gds.graph.project(
    'graph',
    'Label',
    { TYPE: { orientation: 'UNDIRECTED' } }
)
----

Now we can run the algorithm by specifying the appropriate ratio and the output relationship types.
We use a random seed value in order to produce deterministic results.

[role=query-example]
--
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.alpha.ml.splitRelationships.mutate('graph', {
    holdoutRelationshipType: 'TYPE_HOLDOUT',
    remainingRelationshipType: 'TYPE_REMAINING',
    holdoutFraction: 0.2,
    negativeSamplingRatio: 1.0,
    randomSeed: 1337
}) YIELD relationshipsWritten
----

[opts=header]
.Results

| relationshipsWritten
| 10

The input graph consists of 5 relationships.
We use 20% (1 relationship) of the relationships to create the 'TYPE_HOLDOUT' relationship type (holdout set).
This creates 1 relationship with positive label.
Because of the `negativeSamplingRatio`, one relationship with negative label is also created.
Finally, the `TYPE_REMAINING` relationship type is formed with the remaining 80% (4 relationships).
These are written as orientation `UNDIRECTED` which counts as writing 8 relationships.

.The mutated graph will look like the following graph when filtered by the `TEST` and `TRAIN` relationship.
[source, cypher, role=noplay]

CREATE
    (n0:Label),
    (n1:Label),
    (n2:Label),
    (n3:Label),
    (n4:Label),
    (n5:Label),

    (n2)-[:TYPE_HOLDOUT { label: 0 } ]->(n5), // negative, non-existing
    (n3)-[:TYPE_HOLDOUT { label: 1 } ]->(n2), // positive, existing

    (n0)<-[:TYPE_REMAINING { prop: 0} ]-(n1),
    (n1)<-[:TYPE_REMAINING { prop: 1} ]-(n2),
    (n3)<-[:TYPE_REMAINING { prop: 9} ]-(n4),
    (n4)<-[:TYPE_REMAINING { prop: 16} ]-(n5),
    (n0)-[:TYPE_REMAINING { prop: 0} ]->(n1),
    (n1)-[:TYPE_REMAINING { prop: 1} ]->(n2),
    (n3)-[:TYPE_REMAINING { prop: 9} ]->(n4),
    (n4)-[:TYPE_REMAINING { prop: 16} ]->(n5)
