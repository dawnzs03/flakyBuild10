:description: This chapter provides explanations and examples for the node property prediction pipelines in the Neo4j Graph Data Science library.


Node property prediction pipelines provide an end-to-end workflow for predicting either discrete labels or numerical values for nodes with supervised machine learning.
The Neo4j Graph Data Science library support the following node property prediction pipelines:

* Beta
