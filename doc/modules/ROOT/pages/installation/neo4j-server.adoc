= Neo4j Server

On a standalone Neo4j Server you need to install and configure GDS manually.

1. Download `neo4j-graph-data-science-[version].zip` from the https://neo4j.com/download-center/#ngds[Neo4j Download Center]. Check the version compatibility with your Neo4j Server on xref:installation/supported-neo4j-versions.adoc[Supported Neo4j versions].

2. Unzip the archive and move the `neo4j-graph-data-science-[version].jar` file into the `$NEO4J_HOME/plugins` directory.

3. Add the following to your `$NEO4J_HOME/conf/neo4j.conf` file:
+
----
dbms.security.procedures.unrestricted=gds.*
----
This configuration entry is necessary because the GDS library accesses low-level components of Neo4j to maximise performance.
+

4. Check if the procedure allowlist is enabled in the `$NEO4J_HOME/conf/neo4j.conf` file, namely if the `dbms.security.procedures.allowlist` option is _not_ commented out with a leading `#` sign. In this case, add the GDS library to the allowlist:
+
----
dbms.security.procedures.allowlist=gds.*
----
You can find more information on allow listing in the link:https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/security/securing-extensions/#allow-listing[Operations Manual].
+

5. Restart the Neo4j Server.
