= Neo4j Desktop

After opening Neo4j Desktop, you can find the _Graph Data Science Library_ plugin in the *Plugins* tab of a database.

The installer downloads the GDS library and installs it in the `plugins` directory of the database.

== Configuration

[NOTE]
====
You can edit the configuration file for a database by clicking on the ellipsis (*...*) button and opening the *Settings...* menu item.
====

The installer automatically adds the following entry to the configuration:

----
dbms.security.procedures.unrestricted=gds.*
----

This configuration entry is necessary because the GDS library accesses low-level components of Neo4j to maximise performance.

If the procedure allowlist is configured, make sure to also include procedures from the GDS library:

----
dbms.security.procedures.allowlist=gds.*
----
