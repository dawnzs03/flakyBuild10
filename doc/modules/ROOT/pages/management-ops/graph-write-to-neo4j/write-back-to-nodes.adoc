= Writing node properties and labels
:description: This chapter explains how to write node properties and labels back to Neo4j.

It is possible to persist computed node properties into a Neo4j database.
We refer to this operation as _writing_.
This is similar to what an algorithm `write` execution mode does, but allows more fine-grained control over the operations.

== Examples

In order to demonstrate the GDS capabilities over node properties, we are going to create a small social network graph in Neo4j and project it into our graph catalog.

.The following Cypher statement will create the example graph in the Neo4j database:
[source, cypher, role=noplay setup-query]
----
CREATE
  (florentin:Person { name: 'Florentin', age: 16 }),
  (adam:Person { name: 'Adam', age: 18 }),
  (veselin:Person { name: 'Veselin', age: 20 }),
  (hobbit:Book { name: 'The Hobbit', numberOfPages: 310 }),
  (florentin)-[:KNOWS { since: 2010 }]->(adam),
  (florentin)-[:KNOWS { since: 2018 }]->(veselin),
  (adam)-[:READ]->(hobbit)
----

.Project the small social network graph:
[source, cypher, role=noplay graph-project-query]
----
CALL gds.graph.project(
  'socialGraph',
  {
    Person: {properties: "age"},
    Book: {}
  },
  ['KNOWS', 'READ']
)
----

.Compute the Degree Centrality in our social graph:
[source, cypher, role=noplay graph-project-query]
----
CALL gds.degree.mutate('socialGraph', {mutateProperty: 'score'})
----

[[catalog-graph-write-node-properties-example]]
=== Write node properties

To write the 'score' property for all node labels in the social graph, we use the following query:

[role=query-example]
--
.Write the `score` property back to Neo4j:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.graph.nodeProperties.write('socialGraph', ['score'])
YIELD propertiesWritten
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| propertiesWritten
| 4
|===
--

The above example requires the `score` property to be present on _at least one_ projected node label, and the properties will be written for all such labels.

==== Renaming properties when writing back

It is possible to rename node properties and write them back to the database under a custom name.
For this, you can use a map where each entry is a tuple `{nodeProperty: 'renamedProperty'}` i.e., the key corresponds to an existing node property in the in-memory graph and the value corresponds to the name to be written back to the database.

For convenience, a map may hold more than one entries.
The `nodeProperties` configuration parameter accepts both strings and maps and any combination of the two inside a list.
This can be helpful when we only want to rename a handful of properties.

[role=query-example]
--
.Write the `age` and `score` properties back to Neo4j with a new name for `score`:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.graph.nodeProperties.write('socialGraph', ['age', {score: 'writtenScore'}])
YIELD nodeProperties
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| nodeProperties
| [age, writtenScore]
|===
--

In the above example, we write  `age` back to the database with its default name whereas we renamed  `score` to `writtenScore` by using a map.


==== NodeLabels

The procedure can be configured to write just the properties for some specific node labels.
In the following example, we will only write back the scores of the `Person` nodes.

[role=query-example]
--
.Write node properties of a specific projected node label to Neo4j:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.graph.nodeProperties.write('socialGraph', ['score'], ['Person'])
YIELD propertiesWritten
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| propertiesWritten
| 3
|===
--

[NOTE]
--
If the `nodeLabels` parameter is specified, it is required that _all_ given node labels have _all_ of the given properties.
--


[[catalog-graph-write-node-label-example]]
=== Write Node Label

To write a new node label to the database for nodes with score higher than `0`, we use the following query:

[role=query-example, group=write-label]
--
.Write the `Reader` node label back to Neo4j:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.alpha.graph.nodeLabel.write('socialGraph', 'Reader', { nodeFilter: 'n.score > 0.0' })
YIELD graphName, nodeCount, nodeLabel, nodeLabelsWritten
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| graphName     | nodeCount | nodeLabel | nodeLabelsWritten
| "socialGraph" | 4         | "Reader"  | 2
|===
--

[role=query-example, group=write-label]
--
.Query the `Reader` node label:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
MATCH (n:Reader) RETURN n.name AS name, labels(n) AS labels
ORDER BY name ASC
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| name       | labels
| "Adam"       | [Person, Reader]
| "Florentin"  | [Person, Reader]
|===
--

As we can see from the database `Veselin` who has `score: 0.0` is not a `Reader`.
