= Writing relationships
:description: This chapter explains how to write relationship properties back to Neo4j.

To persist relationship types in a Neo4j database, we can use `gds.graph.relationship.write`.
Similar to streaming relationship topologies or properties, it is also possible to write back to the Neo4j database.
This is similar to what an algorithm `write` execution mode does, but allows more fine-grained control over the operations.

By default, no relationship properties will be written. To write relationship properties, these have to be explicitly specified.

== Examples

We can write relationships stored in a named in-memory graph back to Neo4j.
This can be used to write algorithm results (for example from xref:algorithms/node-similarity.adoc[Node Similarity]) or relationships that have been aggregated during graph creation.

The relationships to write are specified by a relationship type.

NOTE: Relationships are always written using a single thread.

In order to demonstrate the GDS capabilities over node properties, we are going to create a small graph in Neo4j and project it into our graph catalog.

image::example-graphs/node-similarity.svg[Visualization of the example graph,align="center"]

// FIXME adjust graph to above
.The following Cypher statement will create the example graph in the Neo4j database:
[source, cypher, role=noplay setup-query]
----
CREATE
  (alice:Person {name: 'Alice'}),
  (bob:Person {name: 'Bob'}),
  (carol:Person {name: 'Carol'}),
  (dave:Person {name: 'Dave'}),
  (eve:Person {name: 'Eve'}),
  (guitar:Instrument {name: 'Guitar'}),
  (synth:Instrument {name: 'Synthesizer'}),
  (bongos:Instrument {name: 'Bongos'}),
  (trumpet:Instrument {name: 'Trumpet'}),

  (alice)-[:LIKES { score: 5 }]->(guitar),
  (alice)-[:LIKES { score: 4 }]->(synth),
  (alice)-[:LIKES { score: 3, strength: 0.5}]->(bongos),
  (bob)-[:LIKES { score: 4 }]->(guitar),
  (bob)-[:LIKES { score: 5 }]->(synth),
  (carol)-[:LIKES { score: 2 }]->(bongos),
  (dave)-[:LIKES { score: 3 }]->(guitar),
  (dave)-[:LIKES { score: 1 }]->(synth),
  (dave)-[:LIKES { score: 5 }]->(bongos)
----

.Project the graph:
[source, cypher, role=noplay graph-project-query]
----
CALL gds.graph.project(
  'personsAndInstruments',
  ['Person', 'Instrument'],         // <1>
  {
    LIKES: {
      type: 'LIKES',                // <2>
      properties: {
        strength: {                 // <3>
          property: 'strength',
          defaultValue: 1.0
        },
        score: {
          property: 'score'         // <4>
        }
      }
    }
  }
)
----
<1> Project node labels `Person` and `Instrument`.
<2> Project relationship type `LIKES`.
<3> Project property `strength` of relationship type `LIKES` setting a default value of `1.0` because not all relationships have that property.
<4> Project property `score` of relationship type `LIKES`.

.Compute the Node Similarity in our graph:
[source, cypher, role=noplay graph-project-query]
----
CALL gds.nodeSimilarity.mutate('personsAndInstruments', {   // <1>
  mutateRelationshipType: 'SIMILAR',                        // <2>
  mutateProperty: 'score'                                   // <3>
})
----
<1> Run NodeSimilarity in `mutate` mode on `personsAndInstruments` projected graph.
<2> The algorithm will add relationships of type `SIMILAR` to the projected graph.
<3> The algorithm will add relationship property `score` for each added relationship.

.Write relationships to Neo4j:

CALL gds.graph.relationship.write(
  'personsAndInstruments',        // <1>
  'SIMILAR'                       // <2>
)
YIELD
  graphName, relationshipType, relationshipProperty, relationshipsWritten, propertiesWritten
----
<1> The name of the projected graph.
<2> The relationship type we want to write back to the Neo4j database.

[opts="header"]

| graphName               | relationshipType | relationshipProperty | relationshipsWritten | propertiesWritten
| "personsAndInstruments" | "SIMILAR"        | null                 | 10                   | 0
|===

By default, no relationship properties will be written, as it can be seen from the results, the `relationshipProperty` value is `null` and `propertiesWritten` are `0`.

Here is an illustration of how the example graph looks in Neo4j after executing the example above.

image::example-graphs/write_relationships_graph.svg[Visualization of the example graph after writing relationships back,align="center"]

The `SIMILAR` relationships have been added to the underlying database and can be used in Cypher queries or for projecting to in-memory graph for running algorithms.
The relationships in this example are undirected because we used xref:algorithms/node-similarity.adoc[Node Similarity] to mutate the in-memory graph and this algorithm creates undirected relationships, this may not be the case if we use different algorithms.


=== Relationship type with property

To write relationship properties, these have to be explicitly specified.

==== Relationship type with multiple properties

In order to demonstrate writing relationships with multiple properties back to Neo4j we will create a small graph in the database first.

image::example-graphs/write-relationship-properties.svg[Visualization of the example graph,align="center"]


.The following Cypher statement will create the graph for this example in the Neo4j database:
[source, cypher, role=noplay setup-query]
----
CREATE
  (alice:Buyer {name: 'Alice'}),
  (instrumentSeller:Seller {name: 'Instrument Seller'}),
  (bob:Buyer {name: 'Bob'}),
  (carol:Buyer {name: 'Carol'}),
  (alice)-[:PAYS { amount: 1.0}]->(instrumentSeller),
  (alice)-[:PAYS { amount: 2.0}]->(instrumentSeller),
  (alice)-[:PAYS { amount: 3.0}]->(instrumentSeller),
  (alice)-[:PAYS { amount: 4.0}]->(instrumentSeller),
  (alice)-[:PAYS { amount: 5.0}]->(instrumentSeller),
  (alice)-[:PAYS { amount: 6.0}]->(instrumentSeller),

  (bob)-[:PAYS { amount: 3.0}]->(instrumentSeller),
  (bob)-[:PAYS { amount: 4.0}]->(instrumentSeller),
  (carol)-[:PAYS { amount: 5.0}]->(bob),
  (carol)-[:PAYS { amount: 6.0}]->(bob)
----

.Project the graph:
[source, cypher, role=noplay graph-project-query]
----
CALL gds.graph.project(
  'aggregatedGraph',
  ['Buyer', 'Seller'],                                                          // <1>
  {
    PAID: {                                                                     // <2>
      type: 'PAYS',                                                             // <3>
      properties: {
        totalAmount: { property: 'amount', aggregation: 'SUM' },                // <4>
        numberOfPayments: { property: 'amount', aggregation: 'COUNT' }          // <5>
      }
    }
  }
)
----
<1> Project node labels `Buyer` and `Seller`.
<2> Project relationship type `PAID` to the in-memory graph.
<3> Use relationship type `PAYS` from the Neo4j database graph.
<4> Project property `totalAmount` of relationship type `PAYS` using `SUM` aggregation.
<5> Project property `numberOfPayments` of relationship type `PAYS` using `COUNT` aggregation.

As we can see the Neo4j graph contains some parallel relationships.
We use GDS projection to condense these into single relationships between the nodes.
In this example we want to track how many times someone paid someone and what is the total amount of all payments.

To write relationship properties, these have to be explicitly specified.

[role=query-example]
--
.Write relationships and their properties to Neo4j:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.graph.relationshipProperties.write(
  'aggregatedGraph',                    // <1>
  'PAID',                               // <2>
  ['totalAmount', 'numberOfPayments'],  // <3>
  {}
)
YIELD
  graphName, relationshipType, relationshipProperties, relationshipsWritten, propertiesWritten
----
<1> The name of the projected graph.
<2> The relationship type we want to write back to the Neo4j database.
<3> The property names of the relationship we want to write back to the Neo4j database.
