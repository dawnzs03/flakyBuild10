= Cypher projection (deprecated)
:description: This section details projecting GDS graphs using legacy `Cypher` projections.
:page-aliases: management-ops/projections/graph-project-cypher.adoc, management-ops/projections/graph-project-cypher-legacy.adoc

[WARNING]
--
This page describes the Legacy Cypher projection, which is deprecated.
The replacement is to use the new Cypher projection, which is described in xref:management-ops/graph-creation/graph-project-cypher-projection.adoc[Projecting graphs using Cypher].
A migration guide is available at xref:migration-lcp-to-cpv2/index.adoc[Appendix C, Migration from Legacy to new Cypher projection].
--

Using Legacy Cypher projections is a more flexible and expressive approach with diminished focus on performance compared to the xref:management-ops/graph-creation/graph-project.adoc[native projections].
Legacy Cypher projections are primarily recommended for the development phase (see xref:common-usage/index.adoc[Common usage]).


== Considerations

=== Lifecycle

[NOTE]
--
The projected graphs will reside in the catalog until either:

- the graph is dropped using xref:management-ops/graph-drop.adoc[gds.graph.drop]
- the Neo4j database from which the graph was projected is stopped or dropped
- the Neo4j database management system is stopped.
--


=== Node property support

Legacy Cypher projections can only project a limited set of node property types from a Cypher query.
The xref:management-ops/graph-creation/index.adoc#node-properties-supported[Node Properties page] details which node property types are supported.
Other types of node properties have to be transformed or encoded into one of the supported types in order to be projected using a Legacy Cypher projection.


[[graph-project-cypher-legacy-syntax]]
== Syntax

A Legacy Cypher projection takes three mandatory arguments: `graphName`, `nodeQuery` and `relationshipQuery`.
In addition, the optional `configuration` parameter allows us to further configure graph creation.

[[graph-project-examples]]
== Examples

In order to demonstrate the GDS Graph Project capabilities we are going to create a small social network graph in Neo4j.
The example graph looks like this:

image::example-graphs/graph-project-example.svg[Visualization of the example graph,align="center"]

.The following Cypher statement will create the example graph in the Neo4j database:
[source, cypher, role=noplay setup-query]
----
CREATE
  (florentin:Person { name: 'Florentin', age: 16 }),
  (adam:Person { name: 'Adam', age: 18 }),
  (veselin:Person { name: 'Veselin', age: 20, ratings: [5.0] }),
  (hobbit:Book { name: 'The Hobbit', isbn: 1234, numberOfPages: 310, ratings: [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.5] }),
  (frankenstein:Book { name: 'Frankenstein', isbn: 4242, price: 19.99 }),

  (adam)-[:READ { numberOfPages: 30 }]->(hobbit),
  (veselin)-[:READ]->(frankenstein)
----


[[graph-project-example-single-label-type]]
=== Simple graph

A simple graph is a graph with only one node label and relationship type, i.e., a monopartite graph.
We are going to start with demonstrating how to load a simple graph by projecting only the `Person` node label and `KNOWS` relationship type.

[role=query-example]
--
.Project `Person` nodes and `KNOWS` relationships:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.graph.project.cypher(
  'persons',
  'MATCH (n:Person) RETURN id(n) AS id',
  'MATCH (n:Person)-[r:KNOWS]->(m:Person) RETURN id(n) AS source, id(m) AS target')
YIELD
  graphName AS graph, nodeQuery, nodeCount AS nodes, relationshipQuery, relationshipCount AS rels
----

.Results
[opts="header", cols="1,3m,1,3m,1m"]
|===
| graph     | nodeQuery                             | nodes  | relationshipQuery                                                                | rels
| "persons" | "MATCH (n:Person) RETURN id(n) AS id" | 3     a| "MATCH (n:Person)-[r:KNOWS]->(m:Person) RETURN id(n) AS source, id(m) AS target" | 2
|===
--


=== Multi-graph

A multi-graph is a graph with multiple node labels and relationship types.

To retain the label and type information when we load multiple node labels and relationship types, we can add a `labels` column to the node query and a `type` column to the relationship query.

[role=query-example]
--
.Project `Person` and `Book` nodes and `KNOWS` and `READ` relationships:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.graph.project.cypher(
  'personsAndBooks',
  'MATCH (n) WHERE n:Person OR n:Book RETURN id(n) AS id, labels(n) AS labels',
  'MATCH (n)-[r:KNOWS|READ]->(m) RETURN id(n) AS source, id(m) AS target, type(r) AS type')
YIELD
  graphName AS graph, nodeQuery, nodeCount AS nodes, relationshipCount AS rels
----

.Results
[opts="header", cols="1,3m,1m,1m"]
|===
| graph             | nodeQuery                                           | nodes  | rels
| "personsAndBooks" | "MATCH (n) WHERE n:Person OR n:Book RETURN id(n) AS id, labels(n) AS labels" | 5      | 6
|===
--


=== Relationship orientation

The native projection supports specifying an orientation per relationship type.
The Legacy Cypher projection treats every relationship returned by the relationship query as if it were in `NATURAL` orientation and creates a directed relationship from the first provided id (source) to the second (target).
Projecting in `REVERSE` orientation can be achieved by switching the order of ids in the RETURN clause such as `MATCH (n)-[r:KNOWS]->(m) RETURN id(m) AS source, id(n) AS target, type(r) AS type`.

It not possible to project graphs in `UNDIRECTED` orientation when Legacy Cypher projections are used.

[NOTE]
--
Some algorithms require that the graph was loaded with `UNDIRECTED` orientation.
These algorithms can not be used with a graph projected by a Legacy Cypher projection.
--


[[node-properties-example]]
=== Node properties

To load node properties, we add a column to the result of the node query for each property.
Thereby, we use the Cypher function https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/functions/scalar/#functions-coalesce[_coalesce()_] function to specify the default value, if the node does not have the property.

[role=query-example, group=cypher-node-properties]
--
.Project `Person` and `Book` nodes and `KNOWS` and `READ` relationships:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.graph.project.cypher(
  'graphWithProperties',
  'MATCH (n)
   WHERE n:Book OR n:Person
   RETURN
    id(n) AS id,
    labels(n) AS labels,
    coalesce(n.age, 18) AS age,
    coalesce(n.price, 5.0) AS price,
    n.ratings AS ratings',
  'MATCH (n)-[r:KNOWS|READ]->(m) RETURN id(n) AS source, id(m) AS target, type(r) AS type'
)
YIELD
  graphName, nodeCount AS nodes, relationshipCount AS rels
RETURN graphName, nodes, rels
----

.Results
[opts="header", cols="1,1,1"]
|===
| graphName             | nodes  | rels
| "graphWithProperties" | 5      | 6
|===
--

The projected `graphWithProperties` graph contains five nodes and six relationships.
In a Legacy Cypher projection every node from the `nodeQuery` gets the same node properties, which means you can't have label-specific properties.
For instance in the example above the `Person` nodes will also get `ratings` and `price` properties, while `Book` nodes get the `age` property.

Further, the `price` property has a default value of `5.0`.
Not every book has a price specified in the example graph.
In the following we check if the price was correctly projected:

[role=query-example, group=cypher-node-properties]
--
.Verify the ratings property of Adam in the projected graph:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
MATCH (n:Book)
RETURN n.name AS name, gds.util.nodeProperty('graphWithProperties', id(n), 'price') AS price
ORDER BY price
----

.Results
[opts="header", cols="1,1"]
|===
| name          | price
| "The Hobbit"  | 5.0
| "Frankenstein"| 19.99
|===
--

We can see, that the price was projected with the Hobbit having the default price of 5.0.


[[cypher-relationship-properties]]
=== Relationship properties

Analogous to node properties, we can project relationship properties using the `relationshipQuery`.

[role=query-example, group=cypher-rel-properties]
--
.Project `Person` and `Book` nodes and `READ` relationships with `numberOfPages` property:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.graph.project.cypher(
  'readWithProperties',
  'MATCH (n) RETURN id(n) AS id, labels(n) AS labels',
  'MATCH (n)-[r:READ]->(m)
    RETURN id(n) AS source, id(m) AS target, type(r) AS type, r.numberOfPages AS numberOfPages'
)
YIELD
  graphName AS graph, nodeCount AS nodes, relationshipCount AS rels
----

.Results
[opts="header", cols="1,1,1"]
|===
| graph                | nodes  | rels
| "readWithProperties" | 5      | 4
|===
--

Next, we will verify that the relationship property `numberOfPages` was correctly loaded.

[role=query-example, group=cypher-rel-properties]
--
.Stream the relationship property `numberOfPages` from the projected graph:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.graph.relationshipProperty.stream('readWithProperties', 'numberOfPages')
YIELD sourceNodeId, targetNodeId, propertyValue AS numberOfPages
RETURN
  gds.util.asNode(sourceNodeId).name AS person,
  gds.util.asNode(targetNodeId).name AS book,
  numberOfPages
ORDER BY person ASC, numberOfPages DESC
----

.Results
[opts="header", cols="1,1,1"]
|===
| person      | book                 | numberOfPages
| "Adam"      |  "The Hobbit"        | 30.0
| "Florentin" |  "The Hobbit"        | 42.0
| "Florentin" |  "The Hobbit"        | 4.0
| "Veselin"   |  "Frankenstein"      | NaN
|===
--

We can see, that the `numberOfPages` are loaded. The default property value is `Double.Nan` and can be changed as in the previous example xref:management-ops/graph-creation/graph-project-cypher-projection.adoc#node-properties-example[Node properties] by using the Cypher function https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/functions/scalar/#functions-coalesce[_coalesce()_].


=== Parallel relationships

The Property Graph Model in Neo4j supports parallel relationships, i.e., multiple relationships between two nodes.
By default, GDS preserves the parallel relationships.
For some algorithms, we want the projected graph to contain at most one relationship between two nodes.

The simplest way to achieve relationship deduplication is to use the `DISTINCT` operator in the relationship query.
Alternatively, we can aggregate the parallel relationship by using the https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/functions/aggregating/#functions-count[_count()_] function and store the count as a relationship property.

[role=query-example, group=cypher-count-aggregate]
--
.Project `Person` and `Book` nodes and `COUNT` aggregated `READ` relationships:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.graph.project.cypher(
  'readCount',
  'MATCH (n) RETURN id(n) AS id, labels(n) AS labels',
  'MATCH (n)-[r:READ]->(m)
    RETURN id(n) AS source, id(m) AS target, type(r) AS type, count(r) AS numberOfReads'
)
YIELD
  graphName AS graph, nodeCount AS nodes, relationshipCount AS rels
----

.Results
[opts="header", cols="1,1,1"]
|===
| graph       | nodes  | rels
| "readCount" | 5      | 3
|===
--

Next, we will verify that the `READ` relationships were correctly aggregated.

[role=query-example, group=cypher-count-aggregate]
--
.Stream the relationship property `numberOfReads` of the projected graph:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.graph.relationshipProperty.stream('readCount', 'numberOfReads')
YIELD sourceNodeId, targetNodeId, propertyValue AS numberOfReads
RETURN
  gds.util.asNode(sourceNodeId).name AS person,
  gds.util.asNode(targetNodeId).name AS book,
  numberOfReads
ORDER BY numberOfReads DESC, person
----

.Results
[opts="header", cols="1,1,1"]
|===
| person      | book                 | numberOfReads
| "Florentin" |  "The Hobbit"        | 2.0
| "Adam"      |  "The Hobbit"        | 1.0
| "Veselin"   |  "Frankenstein"      | 1.0
|===
--

We can see, that the two READ relationships between Florentin and the Hobbit result in `2` numberOfReads.


=== Parallel relationships with properties

For graphs with relationship properties we can also use other aggregations documented in the https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/functions/aggregating/[Cypher Manual].

[role=query-example, group=cypher-sum-aggregate]
--
.Project `Person` and `Book` nodes and aggregated `READ` relationships by summing the `numberOfPages`:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.graph.project.cypher(
  'readSums',
  'MATCH (n) RETURN id(n) AS id, labels(n) AS labels',
  'MATCH (n)-[r:READ]->(m)
    RETURN id(n) AS source, id(m) AS target, type(r) AS type, sum(r.numberOfPages) AS numberOfPages'
)
YIELD
  graphName AS graph, nodeCount AS nodes, relationshipCount AS rels
----

.Results
[opts="header", cols="1,1,1"]
|===
| graph      | nodes  | rels
| "readSums" | 5      | 3
|===
--

Next, we will verify that the relationship property `numberOfPages` were correctly aggregated.

[role=query-example, group=cypher-sum-aggregate]
--
.Stream the relationship property `numberOfPages` of the projected graph:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.graph.relationshipProperty.stream('readSums', 'numberOfPages')
YIELD sourceNodeId, targetNodeId, propertyValue AS numberOfPages
RETURN
  gds.util.asNode(sourceNodeId).name AS person,
  gds.util.asNode(targetNodeId).name AS book,
  numberOfPages
ORDER BY numberOfPages DESC, person
----

.Results
[opts="header", cols="1,1,1"]
|===
| person      | book                 | numberOfPages
| "Florentin" |  "The Hobbit"        | 46.0
| "Adam"      |  "The Hobbit"        | 30.0
| "Veselin"   |  "Frankenstein"      | 0.0
|===
--

We can see, that the two `READ` relationships between Florentin and the Hobbit sum up to `46` numberOfPages.


=== Projecting filtered Neo4j graphs

Cypher-projections allow us to specify the graph to project in a more fine-grained way.
The following examples will demonstrate how we to filter out `READ` relationship if they do not have a `numberOfPages` property.

[role=query-example, group=cypher-rel-filtering-properties]
--
.Project `Person` and `Book` nodes and `READ` relationships where `numberOfPages` is present:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.graph.project.cypher(
  'existingNumberOfPages',
  'MATCH (n) RETURN id(n) AS id, labels(n) AS labels',
  'MATCH (n)-[r:READ]->(m)
    WHERE r.numberOfPages IS NOT NULL
    RETURN id(n) AS source, id(m) AS target, type(r) AS type, r.numberOfPages AS numberOfPages'
)
YIELD
  graphName AS graph, nodeCount AS nodes, relationshipCount AS rels
----

.Results
[opts="header", cols="1,1,1"]
|===
| graph                   | nodes  | rels
| "existingNumberOfPages" | 5      | 3
|===
--

Next, we will verify that the relationship property `numberOfPages` was correctly loaded.

[role=query-example, group=cypher-rel-filtering-properties]
--
.Stream the relationship property `numberOfPages` from the projected graph:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.graph.relationshipProperty.stream('existingNumberOfPages', 'numberOfPages')
YIELD sourceNodeId, targetNodeId, propertyValue AS numberOfPages
RETURN
  gds.util.asNode(sourceNodeId).name AS person,
  gds.util.asNode(targetNodeId).name AS book,
  numberOfPages
ORDER BY person ASC, numberOfPages DESC
----

.Results
[opts="header", cols="1,1,1"]
|===
| person      | book                 | numberOfPages
| "Adam"      |  "The Hobbit"        | 30.0
| "Florentin" |  "The Hobbit"        | 42.0
| "Florentin" |  "The Hobbit"        | 4.0
|===
--

If we compare the results to the ones from xref:management-ops/graph-creation/graph-project-cypher-legacy.adoc#cypher-relationship-properties[Relationship properties], we can see that using `IS NOT NULL` is filtering out the relationship from Veselin to the book Frankenstein.
This functionality is only expressible with xref:management-ops/graph-creation/graph-project.adoc[native projections] by projecting a xref:management-ops/graph-creation/graph-project-subgraph.adoc[subgraph].

[[cypher-projection-parameters]]
=== Using query parameters

Similar to https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/syntax/parameters/[Cypher], it is also possible to set query parameters.
In the following example we supply a list of strings to limit the cities we want to project.

.Project `Person` and `Book` nodes and `READ` relationships where `numberOfPages` is greater than 9:
[role=query-example]
--
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.graph.project.cypher(
  'existingNumberOfPages',
  'MATCH (n) RETURN id(n) AS id, labels(n) AS labels',
  'MATCH (n)-[r:READ]->(m)
    WHERE r.numberOfPages > $minNumberOfPages
    RETURN id(n) AS source, id(m) AS target, type(r) AS type, r.numberOfPages AS numberOfPages',
  { parameters: { minNumberOfPages: 9} }
)
YIELD
  graphName AS graph, nodeCount AS nodes, relationshipCount AS rels

----

.Results
[opts="header", cols="1,1,1"]
|===
| graph                   | nodes  | rels
| "existingNumberOfPages" | 5      | 2
|===
--

=== Further usage of parameters

The parameters can also be used to directly pass in a list of nodes or a list of relationships.
For example, pre-computing the list of nodes can be useful if the node filter is expensive.

.Project `Person` nodes younger than 17 and their name not beginning with _V_, and `KNOWS` relationships:
[role=query-example]
--
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.graph.project.cypher(
  'personSubset',
  'MATCH (n)
    WHERE n.age < 20 AND NOT n.name STARTS WITH "V"
    RETURN id(n) AS id, labels(n) AS labels',
  'MATCH (n)-[r:KNOWS]->(m)
    WHERE (n.age < 20 AND NOT n.name STARTS WITH "V") AND
          (m.age < 20 AND NOT m.name STARTS WITH "V")
    RETURN id(n) AS source, id(m) AS target, type(r) AS type, r.numberOfPages AS numberOfPages'
)
YIELD
  graphName, nodeCount AS nodes, relationshipCount AS rels
----

.Results
[opts="header", cols="1,1,1"]
|===
| graphName      | nodes  | rels
| "personSubset" | 2      | 1
|===
--

By passing the relevant Persons as a parameter, the above query can be transformed into the following:

.Project `Person` nodes younger than 20 and their name not beginning with _V_, and `KNOWS` relationships by using parameters:
[role=query-example]
--
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
MATCH (n)
WHERE n.age < 20 AND NOT n.name STARTS WITH "V"
WITH collect(n) AS olderPersons
CALL gds.graph.project.cypher(
  'personSubsetViaParameters',
  'UNWIND $nodes AS n RETURN id(n) AS id, labels(n) AS labels',
  'MATCH (n)-[r:KNOWS]->(m)
    WHERE (n IN $nodes) AND (m IN $nodes)
    RETURN id(n) AS source, id(m) AS target, type(r) AS type, r.numberOfPages AS numberOfPages',
  { parameters: { nodes: olderPersons} }
)
 YIELD
  graphName, nodeCount AS nodes, relationshipCount AS rels
 RETURN graphName, nodes, rels
----

.Results
[opts="header", cols="1,1,1"]
