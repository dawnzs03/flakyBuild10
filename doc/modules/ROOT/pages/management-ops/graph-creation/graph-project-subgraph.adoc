= Filtering
:description: This section details how to project subgraphs from existing graphs stored in the graph catalog of the Neo4j Graph Data Science library.

[TIP]
====
Subgraph projection is featured in the end-to-end example Jupyter notebooks:

In GDS, algorithms can be executed on a named graph that has been filtered based on its xref:common-usage/running-algos.adoc#common-configuration-node-labels[node labels] and xref:common-usage/running-algos.adoc#common-configuration-relationship-types[relationship types].
However, that filtered graph only exists during the execution of the algorithm, and it is not possible to filter on property values.
If a filtered graph needs to be used multiple times, one can use the subgraph catalog procedure to project a new graph in the graph catalog.

The filter predicates in the subgraph procedure can take labels, relationship types as well as node and relationship properties into account.
The new graph can be used in the same way as any other in-memory graph in the catalog.
Projecting subgraphs of subgraphs is also possible.


== Syntax

[.project-subgraph-syntax]
--
.A new graph can be projected by using the `gds.beta.graph.project.subgraph()` procedure:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.beta.graph.project.subgraph(
  graphName: String,
  fromGraphName: String,
  nodeFilter: String,
  relationshipFilter: String,
  configuration: Map
) YIELD
  graphName: String,
  fromGraphName: String,
  nodeFilter: String,
  relationshipFilter: String,
  nodeCount: Integer,
  relationshipCount: Integer,
  projectMillis: Integer

The `nodeFilter` and `relationshipFilter` configuration keys can be used to express filter predicates.
Filter predicates are https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/clauses/where/#query-where[Cypher] predicates bound to a single entity.
An entity is either a node or a relationship.
The filter predicate always needs to evaluate to `true` or `false`.
A node is contained in the subgraph if the node filter evaluates to `true`.
A relationship is contained in the subgraph if the relationship filter evaluates to `true` and its source and target nodes are contained in the subgraph.

A predicate is a combination of expressions.
The simplest form of expression is a literal.
GDS currently supports the following literals:

* float literals, e.g., `13.37`
* integer literals, e.g., `42`
* boolean literals, i.e., `TRUE` and `FALSE`

Property, label and relationship type expressions are bound to an entity.
The node entity is always identified by the variable `n`, the relationship entity is identified by `r`.
Using the variable, we can refer to:

* node label expression, e.g., `n:Person`
* relationship type expression, e.g., `r:KNOWS`
* node property expression, e.g., `n.age`
* relationship property expression, e.g., `r.since`

Boolean predicates combine two expressions and return either `true` or `false`.
GDS supports the following boolean predicates:

* greater/lower than, such as `n.age > 42` or `r.since < 1984`
* greater/lower than or equal, such as `n.age > 42` or `r.since < 1984`
* equality, such as `n.age = 23` or `r.since = 2020`
* logical operators, such as
  * `n.age > 23 AND n.age < 42`
  * `n.age = 23 OR n.age = 42`
  * `n.age = 23 XOR n.age = 42`
  * `n.age IS NOT 23`

Variable names that can be used within predicates are not arbitrary.
A node predicate must refer to variable `n`.
A relationship predicate must refer to variable `r`.


== Examples

In order to demonstrate the GDS project subgraph capabilities we are going to create a small social graph in Neo4j.

.The following Cypher statement will create the example graph in the Neo4j database:
[source, cypher, role=noplay setup-query]
----
CREATE
  (p0:Person { age: 16 }),
  (p1:Person { age: 18 }),
  (p2:Person { age: 20 }),
  (b0:Book   { isbn: 1234 }),
  (b1:Book   { isbn: 4242 }),
  (p0)-[:KNOWS { since: 2010 }]->(p1),
  (p0)-[:KNOWS { since: 2018 }]->(p2),
  (p0)-[:READS]->(b0),
  (p1)-[:READS]->(b0),
  (p2)-[:READS]->(b1)
----

.Project the social network graph:
[source, cypher, role=noplay graph-project-query]
----
CALL gds.graph.project(
  'social-graph',
  {
    Person: { properties: 'age' },    // <1>
    Book: {}                          // <2>
  },
  {
    KNOWS: { properties: 'since' },   // <3>
    READS: {}                         // <4>
  }
)
YIELD graphName, nodeCount, relationshipCount, projectMillis
----
<1> Project `Person` nodes with their `age` property.
<2> Project `Book` nodes without any of their properties.
<3> Project `KNOWS` relationships with their `since` property.
<4> Project `READS` relationships without any of their properties.

=== Node filtering

[role=query-example]
--
.Create a new graph containing only users of a certain age group:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.beta.graph.project.subgraph(
  'teenagers',
  'social-graph',
  'n.age > 13 AND n.age <= 18',
  '*'
)
YIELD graphName, fromGraphName, nodeCount, relationshipCount
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| graphName    | fromGraphName    | nodeCount | relationshipCount
| "teenagers"  | "social-graph"   | 2         | 1
|===
--


=== Node and relationship filtering

[role=query-example]
--
.Create a new graph containing only users of a certain age group that know each other since a given point a time:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.beta.graph.project.subgraph(
  'teenagers',
  'social-graph',
  'n.age > 13 AND n.age <= 18',
  'r.since >= 2012.0'
)
YIELD graphName, fromGraphName, nodeCount, relationshipCount
----
.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| graphName    | fromGraphName    | nodeCount | relationshipCount
| "teenagers"  | "social-graph"   | 2         | 0
|===
--


=== Bipartite subgraph

[role=query-example]
--
.Create a new bipartite graph between books and users connected by the `READS` relationship type:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.beta.graph.project.subgraph(
  'teenagers-books',
  'social-graph',
  'n:Book OR n:Person',
  'r:READS'
)
YIELD graphName, fromGraphName, nodeCount, relationshipCount
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| graphName          | fromGraphName    | nodeCount | relationshipCount
| "teenagers-books"  | "social-graph"   | 5         | 3
|===
--


=== Bipartite graph node filtering

[role=query-example]
--
.The previous example can be extended with an additional filter applied only to persons:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.beta.graph.project.subgraph(
  'teenagers-books',
  'social-graph',
  'n:Book OR (n:Person AND n.age > 18)',
  'r:READS'
)
YIELD graphName, fromGraphName, nodeCount, relationshipCount
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| graphName    | fromGraphName    | nodeCount | relationshipCount
| "teenagers-books"  | "social-graph"   | 3         | 1
|===
--


=== Using query parameters

Similar to https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/syntax/parameters/[Cypher], it is also possible to set query parameters.
As an example we can rewrite the xref:management-ops/graph-creation/graph-project-subgraph.adoc#catalog-graph-project-subgraph-node-filter-example[node filter example] from above using parameters instead of integer literals:

[role=query-example]
--
.Create a new graph containing only users of a certain age group:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.beta.graph.project.subgraph(
  'teenagers-parameterized',
  'social-graph',
  'n.age > $lower AND n.age <= $upper',
  '*',
  { parameters: { lower: 13, upper: 18 } }
)
YIELD graphName, fromGraphName, nodeCount, relationshipCount
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| graphName                  | fromGraphName    | nodeCount | relationshipCount
| "teenagers-parameterized"  | "social-graph"   | 2         | 1
