:description: This section explains how to back up and restore graphs and models in the Neo4j Graph Data Science library.


include::partial$/common-usage/not-on-aurads-note.adoc[]

include::partial$/operations-reference/alpha-note.adoc[]

In the Neo4j Graph Data Science library, graphs and machine learning models are stored in-memory.
This is necessary mainly for performance reasons but has the disadvantage that data will be lost after shutting down the database.
There are already concepts to circumvent this limitation, such as running algorithms in xref:common-usage/running-algos.adoc#running-algos-write[write mode], xref:management-ops/graph-export/graph-export-csv.adoc#catalog-graph-export-csv[exporting graphs to csv] or xref:model-catalog/store.adoc#model-catalog-store-ops[storing models].
The back-up and restore procedures described in this section will provide a simple and uniform way of saving graphs and models in order to load them back into memory after a database restart.

[NOTE]
====
The `gds.export.location` parameter must be configured for this feature.

== Examples

First we need to create a graph in the corresponding Neo4j database.

.The following Cypher statement will create the example graph in the Neo4j database:
[source, cypher, role=noplay setup-query]
----
CREATE
  (alice:Person {name: 'Alice'}),
  (bridget:Person {name: 'Bridget'}),

  (alice)-[:KNOWS]->(bridget)
----

Now we need to project an in-memory graph which we want to back-up.

.The following statement will project a graph using a native projection and store it in the graph catalog under the name 'myGraph'.
[source, cypher, role=noplay graph-project-query, operator=me]
----
CALL gds.graph.project(
  'myGraph',
  'Person',
  'KNOWS'
)
----

We can now run the back-up procedure in order to store the in-memory graph on disk.

[role=query-example, group=backrestoregroup, operator=me]
--
.The following will run the back-up procedure:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.alpha.backup()
YIELD graphName, status
----

.Results
[opts="header",cols="1m,1m"]
|===
| graphName | status
| "myGraph" | "SUCCESSFUL"
|===
--

It is now safe to drop the in-memory graph or shutdown the db, as we can restore it at a later point.
[role=query-example, no-result=true, group=backrestoregroup, operator=me]
--
.The following will drop the in-memory graph:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.graph.drop('myGraph')
----
--

If we want to restore the backed-up graph, we can simply run the restore procedure to load it back into memory.
[role=query-example, group=backrestoregroup, operator=me]
--
.The following will run the restore procedure:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.alpha.restore()
YIELD restoredGraph
----

.Results
[opts="header",cols="1m"]
|===
| restoredGraph
| "myGraph"
|===
--

As we can see, one graph with name `myGraph` was restored by the procedure.
