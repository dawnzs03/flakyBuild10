= Dropping parts of the graph
:description: This chapter explains how to drop node properties or relationships of a given type from a projected graph.

Dropping parts of the graph is useful to free up memory or remove previously mutated algorithms results.

== Examples

In order to demonstrate the GDS capabilities over node properties, we are going to create a small social network graph in Neo4j and project it into our graph catalog.

.The following Cypher statement will create the example graph in the Neo4j database:
[source, cypher, role=noplay setup-query]
----
CREATE
  (florentin:Person { name: 'Florentin', age: 16 }),
  (adam:Person { name: 'Adam', age: 18 }),
  (veselin:Person { name: 'Veselin', age: 20 }),
  (hobbit:Book { name: 'The Hobbit', numberOfPages: 310 }),
  (florentin)-[:KNOWS { since: 2010 }]->(adam),
  (florentin)-[:KNOWS { since: 2018 }]->(veselin),
  (adam)-[:READ]->(hobbit)
----

.Project the small social network graph:
[source, cypher, role=noplay graph-project-query]
----
CALL gds.graph.project(
  'socialGraph',
  {
    Person: {properties: "age"},
    Book: {}
  },
  ['KNOWS', 'READ']
)
----

.Compute the Degree Centrality in our social graph:
[source, cypher, role=noplay graph-project-query]
----
CALL gds.degree.mutate('socialGraph', {mutateProperty: 'score'})
----

[[catalog-graph-remove-node-properties-example]]
=== Dropping node properties


[role=query-example]
--
.Drop the `score` property from all projected nodes in the `socialGraph`:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.graph.nodeProperties.drop('socialGraph', ['score'])
YIELD propertiesRemoved
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| propertiesRemoved
| 4
|===
--

[NOTE]
--
The above example requires all given properties to be present on _at least one_ projected node label.
--

[[catalog-graph-delete-rel-type]]
=== Drop relationships of a given type

We can drop all relationships of a given type from a named graph in the catalog.
This is useful to free up main memory or to drop accidentally added relationship types.

[NOTE]
====
Deleting relationships of a given type is only possible if it is not the last relationship type present in the graph.
If we still want to drop these relationships we need to xref:management-ops/graph-drop.adoc[drop the graph] instead.
====

[role=query-example]
--
.Drop all relationships of type `SIMILAR` from a named graph:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.graph.relationships.drop(
  'socialGraph',                    // <1>
  'READ'                            // <2>
)
YIELD
  graphName, relationshipType, deletedRelationships, deletedProperties
----
<1> The name of the projected graph.
<2> The relationship type we want to delete from the projected graph.

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| graphName     | relationshipType | deletedRelationships | deletedProperties
| "socialGraph" | "READ"        | 1                   | {}
|===
