= Converting directed relationships to undirected
:description: This section details the converting directed relationships to undirected in the Neo4j Graph Data Science library.

include::partial$/operations-reference/beta-note.adoc[]

== Introduction

In GDS, some algorithms such as Triangle Count and Link Prediction expect undirected relationships. This procedure converts directed relationships to undirected and outputs the result as a new relationship type.
This can be useful to convert relationships produced by algorithms such as path algorithms.

Using map allows specifying aggregations per relationship property. By default we will use the existing aggregation used during the initial projection.

== Example

In order to demonstrate converting directed relationships to undirected, we are going to create a small graph in Neo4j and project it into our graph catalog.

image::example-graphs/node-similarity.svg[Visualization of the example graph,align="center"]

.The following Cypher statement will create the example graph in the Neo4j database:
[source, cypher, role=noplay setup-query]
----
CREATE
  (alice:Person {name: 'Alice'}),
  (bob:Person {name: 'Bob'}),
  (carol:Person {name: 'Carol'}),
  (dave:Person {name: 'Dave'}),
  (eve:Person {name: 'Eve'}),
  (guitar:Instrument {name: 'Guitar'}),
  (synth:Instrument {name: 'Synthesizer'}),
  (bongos:Instrument {name: 'Bongos'}),
  (trumpet:Instrument {name: 'Trumpet'}),

  (alice)-[:LIKES { score: 5 }]->(guitar),
  (alice)-[:LIKES { score: 4 }]->(synth),
  (alice)-[:LIKES { score: 3}]->(bongos),
  (bob)-[:LIKES { score: 4 }]->(guitar),
  (bob)-[:LIKES { score: 5 }]->(synth),
  (carol)-[:LIKES { score: 2 }]->(bongos),
  (dave)-[:LIKES { score: 3 }]->(guitar),
  (dave)-[:LIKES { score: 1 }]->(synth),
  (dave)-[:LIKES { score: 5 }]->(bongos)
----

.Project the graph:
[source, cypher, role=noplay graph-project-query]
----
CALL gds.graph.project(
  'personsAndInstruments',
  ['Person', 'Instrument'],
  {
    LIKES: {
      type: 'LIKES',
      properties: 'score'
    }
  }
)
----


The following shows how to convert the relationships of type `LIKES` in the graph from directed to undirected by creating an undirected relationship of new type `INTERACTS`.

  {relationshipType: 'LIKES', mutateRelationshipType: 'INTERACTS'}  // <2>
)
YIELD
  inputRelationships, relationshipsWritten
----
<1> The name of the projected graph.
<2> A map that includes the relationship type to make undirected and the relationship type to be added to the graph.
