[[algorithms-collapse-path-intro]]
== Introduction

The Collapse Path algorithm is a traversal algorithm capable of creating relationships between the start and end nodes of a traversal.
In other words, the path between a start node and an end node is collapsed into a single relationship (a direct path).
The algorithm is intended to support the creation of monopartite graphs required by many graph algorithms.

The main input for the algorithm is a list of path templates.
Starting from every node in the specified graph, the relationships of each template are traversed one after the other using the order specified in the configuration.
Only nodes reached after traversing entire paths are used as end nodes.
Exactly one directed relationship is created for every pair of nodes for which at least one path from start to end node exists.

== Examples

Consider the graph created by the following Cypher statement:

[source, cypher, role=noplay setup-query]
----
CREATE
  (Dan:Person),
  (Annie:Person),
  (Matt:Person),
  (Jeff:Person),

  (Guitar:Instrument),
  (Flute:Instrument),

  (Dan)-[:PLAYS]->(Guitar),
  (Annie)-[:PLAYS]->(Guitar),

  (Matt)-[:PLAYS]->(Flute),
  (Jeff)-[:PLAYS]->(Flute)
----

In this example we want to create a relationship, called `PLAYS_SAME_INSTRUMENT`, between `Person` nodes that play the same instrument.
To achieve that we have to traverse a path specified by the following Cypher pattern:

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
(p1:Person)-[:PLAYS]->(:Instrument)-[:PLAYED_BY]->(p2:Person)
----

In our source graph only the `PLAYS` relationship type exists.
The `PLAYED_BY` relationship type can be created by loading the `PLAYS` relationship type in `REVERSE` direction.
The following query will project such a graph:

[source, cypher, role=noplay graph-project-query]
----
CALL gds.graph.project(
  'persons',
  ['Person', 'Instrument'],
  {
    PLAYS: {
      orientation: 'NATURAL'
    },
    PLAYED_BY: {
      type: 'PLAYS',
      orientation: 'REVERSE'
    }
})
----

Now we can run the algorithm by specifying the traversal `PLAYS, PLAYED_BY` in the `pathTemplates` option.

[role=query-example]
--
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.beta.collapsePath.mutate(
  'persons',
  {
    pathTemplates: [['PLAYS', 'PLAYED_BY']],
    allowSelfLoops: false,
    mutateRelationshipType: 'PLAYS_SAME_INSTRUMENT'
  }
) YIELD relationshipsWritten

.The mutated graph will look like the following graph when filtered by the `PLAYS_SAME_INSTRUMENT` relationship

  (Annie:Person),
  (Matt:Person),
  (Jeff:Person),

  (Guitar:Instrument),
  (Flute:Instrument),

  (Dan)-[:PLAYS_SAME_INSTRUMENT]->(Annie),
  (Annie)-[:PLAYS_SAME_INSTRUMENT]->(Dan),

  (Matt)-[:PLAYS_SAME_INSTRUMENT]->(Jeff),
