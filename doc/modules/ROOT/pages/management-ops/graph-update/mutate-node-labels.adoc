= Adding node labels
:description: This chapter explains how to add node properties to a projected graph.

Adding node labels to the graph after the creation can be used to create labels based on f.i. algorithm results.
As with existing labels, they allow filtering the graph on following operations.

== Example

In order to demonstrate the GDS capabilities over node properties, we are going to create a small social network graph in Neo4j and project it into our graph catalog.

.The following Cypher statement will create the example graph in the Neo4j database:
[source, cypher, role=noplay setup-query]
----
CREATE
  (florentin:Person { name: 'Florentin', age: 16 }),
  (adam:Person { name: 'Adam', age: 18 }),
  (veselin:Person { name: 'Veselin', age: 20 }),
  (hobbit:Book { name: 'The Hobbit', numberOfPages: 310 }),
  (florentin)-[:KNOWS { since: 2010 }]->(adam),
  (florentin)-[:KNOWS { since: 2018 }]->(veselin),
  (adam)-[:READ]->(hobbit)
----

.Project the small social network graph:
[source, cypher, role=noplay graph-project-query]
----
CALL gds.graph.project(
  'socialGraph',
  {
    Person: {properties: "age"},
    Book: {}
  },
  ['KNOWS', 'READ']
)
----

.Compute the Degree Centrality in our social graph:
[source, cypher, role=noplay graph-project-query]
----
CALL gds.degree.mutate('socialGraph', {mutateProperty: 'score'})
----


To mutate the in-memory graph by adding a new node label for nodes with score higher than `0`, we use the following query:

[role=query-example, group=mutate-label]
--
.Add the `Reader` node label to the in-memory graph:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.alpha.graph.nodeLabel.mutate('socialGraph', 'Reader', { nodeFilter: 'n.score > 0.0' })
YIELD graphName, nodeLabel, nodeLabelsWritten, nodeCount
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| graphName     | nodeLabel | nodeLabelsWritten | nodeCount
| "socialGraph" | "Reader"  | 2                 | 4
|===
--

As we can see from the result there were two nodes that matched the specified filter and they received the node label `Reader`.
We can inspect the result by streaming back the `score` property of the `Reader` node label, we can do that using the following query:

[role=query-example, group=mutate-label]
--
.Stream the `score` property for `Reader` nodes:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.graph.nodeProperty.stream('socialGraph', 'score', ['Reader'])
YIELD nodeId, propertyValue
RETURN gds.util.asNode(nodeId).name AS name, propertyValue AS score
ORDER BY score DESC
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| name        | score
| "Florentin" | 2.0
| "Adam"      | 1.0
|===
--

We can see that `Veselin` has not been labelled as a `Reader` because the `score` property for that node is `0`.
