= Check if a graph exists
:page-aliases: graph-exists

We can check if a graph is stored in the catalog by looking up its name.

== Syntax

[.graph-exists-syntax]
--
.Check if a graph exists in the catalog:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.graph.exists(graphName: String) YIELD
  graphName: String,
  exists: Boolean
----


[[graph-exists-syntax]]
.Parameters
[opts="header",cols="1,1,1,4"]
|===
| Name          | Type      | Optional             | Description
| graphName     | String    | no                   | The name under which the graph is stored in the catalog.
|===

.Results
[opts="header",cols="3m,1,6"]
|===
| Name              | Type     | Description
| graphName         | String   | Name of the removed graph.
| exists            | Boolean  | If the graph exists in the graph catalog.
|===
--

Additionally, to the procedure, we provide a function which directly returns the exists field from the procedure.

.Check if a graph exists in the catalog:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
RETURN gds.graph.exists(graphName: String)::Boolean
----


== Examples

In order to demonstrate the GDS Graph Exists capabilities we are going to create a small social network graph in Neo4j and project it into our graph catalog.

.The following Cypher statement will create the example graph in the Neo4j database:
[source, cypher, role=noplay setup-query]
----
CREATE
  (florentin:Person { name: 'Florentin', age: 16 }),
  (adam:Person { name: 'Adam', age: 18 }),
  (veselin:Person { name: 'Veselin', age: 20 }),
  (florentin)-[:KNOWS { since: 2010 }]->(adam),
  (florentin)-[:KNOWS { since: 2018 }]->(veselin)
----

.Project `Person` nodes and `KNOWS` relationships:
[source, cypher, role=noplay graph-project-query]
----
CALL gds.graph.project('persons', 'Person', 'KNOWS')
----


== Procedure

[role=query-example]
--
.Check if graphs exist in the catalog:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
UNWIND ['persons', 'books'] AS graph
CALL gds.graph.exists(graph)
  YIELD graphName, exists
RETURN graphName, exists
----

.Results
[opts="header",cols="1,1"]
|===
| graphName      | exists
| "persons"      | true
| "books"        | false
|===
--

We can verify the projected `persons` graph exists while a `books` graph does not.


== Function

As an alternative to the procedure, we can also use the corresponding function.
Unlike procedures, functions can be inlined in other cypher-statements such as `RETURN` or `WHERE`.

[role=query-example]
--
.Check if graphs exists in the catalog:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
RETURN gds.graph.exists('persons') AS personsExists, gds.graph.exists('books') AS booksExists
----

.Results
[opts="header",cols="1,1"]
|===
| personsExists      | booksExists
| true              | false
|===
--

As before, we can verify the projected `persons` graph exists while a `books` graph does not.
