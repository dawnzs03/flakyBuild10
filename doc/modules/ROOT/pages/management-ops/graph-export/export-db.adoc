= Export to a new Neo4j database

include::partial$/common-usage/not-on-aurads-note.adoc[]

We can create new Neo4j databases from projected graphs stored in the graph catalog.
All nodes, relationships and properties present in the projected graph are written to a new Neo4j database.
This includes data that has been projected in `gds.graph.project` and data that has been added by running algorithms in `mutate` mode.
The newly created database will be stored in the Neo4j `databases` directory using a given database name.

The feature is useful in the following, exemplary scenarios:

* Avoid heavy write load on the operational system by exporting the data instead of writing back.
* Create an analytical view of the operational system that can be used as a basis for running algorithms.
* Produce snapshots of analytical results and persistent them for archiving and inspection.
* Share analytical results within the organization.

== Example

.Export the `my-graph` from GDS into a Neo4j database called `mydatabase`:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.graph.export('my-graph', { dbName: 'mydatabase' })
----

The new database can be started using link:https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/administration/databases/#administration-databases-start-database[databases management commands].


[NOTE]
====
The database must not exist when using the export procedure. It needs to be created manually using the following commands.
====


.After running exporting the graph, we can start a new database and query the exported graph:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
:use system
CREATE DATABASE mydatabase;
:use mydatabase
MATCH (n) RETURN n;
----


== Example with additional node properties

Suppose we have a graph `my-db-graph` in the Neo4j database that has a string node property `myproperty`, and that we have a corresponding in-memory graph called `my-in-memory-graph` which does not have the `myproperty` node property.
If we want to export `my-in-memory-graph` but additionally add the `myproperty` properties from `my-db-graph` we can use the `additionalProperties` configuration parameter.

.Export the `my-in-memory-graph` from GDS with `myproperty` from `my-db-graph` into a Neo4j database called `mydatabase`:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.graph.export('my-graph', { dbName: 'mydatabase', additionalNodeProperties: ['myproperty']})
----

The new database can be started using link:https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/administration/databases/#administration-databases-start-database[databases management commands].

[NOTE]
====
The original database (`my-db-graph`) must not have changed since loading the in-memory representation (`my-in-memory-graph`) that we export in order for the export to work correctly.
====

The `additionalNodeProperties` parameter uses the same syntax as `nodeProperties` of the xref:management-ops/graph-creation/graph-project.adoc[graph project procedure].
So we could for instance define a default value for our `myproperty`.

.Export the `my-in-memory-graph` from GDS with `myproperty` from `my-db-graph` with default value into a Neo4j database called `mydatabase`:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.graph.export('my-graph', { dbName: 'mydatabase', additionalNodeProperties: [{ myproperty: {defaultValue: 'my-default-value'}}] })
----
