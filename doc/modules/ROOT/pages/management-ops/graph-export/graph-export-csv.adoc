= Export to CSV

include::partial$/common-usage/not-on-aurads-note.adoc[]
include::partial$/operations-reference/beta-note.adoc[]

We can export graphs stored in the graph catalog to a set of CSV files.
All nodes, relationships and properties present in a graph are exported.
This includes data that has been projected with `gds.graph.project` and data that has been added by running algorithms in `mutate` mode.
The location of the exported CSV files can be configured via the configuration parameter `gds.export.location` in the `neo4j.conf`.
All files will be stored in a subfolder using the specified export name.
The export will fail if a folder with the given export name already exists.

[NOTE]
====
The `gds.export.location` parameter must be configured for this feature.

== Estimation

As many other procedures in GDS, export to csv has an estimation mode. For more details see xref:common-usage/memory-estimation.adoc[Memory Estimation].
Using the `gds.beta.graph.export.csv.estimate` procedure, it is possible to estimate the required disk space of the exported CSV files.
The estimation uses sampling to generate a more accurate estimate.

== Export format

The format of the exported CSV files is based on the format that is supported by the Neo4j Admin https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/tools/neo4j-admin/neo4j-admin-import/[import] command.


=== Nodes

Nodes are exported into files grouped by the nodes labels, i.e., for every label combination that exists in the graph a set of export files is created.
The naming schema of the exported files is: `nodes_LABELS_INDEX.csv`, where:

- `LABELS` is the ordered list of labels joined by `_`.
- `INDEX` is a number between 0 and concurrency.

For each label combination one or more data files are created, as each exporter thread exports into a separate file.

Additionally, each label combination produces a single header file, which contains a single line describing the columns in the data files
More information about the header files can be found here: https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/tools/neo4j-admin/neo4j-admin-import/#import-tool-header-format[CSV header format].

For example a Graph with the node combinations `:A`, `:B` and `:A:B` might create the following files

----
nodes_A_header.csv
nodes_A_0.csv
nodes_B_header.csv
nodes_B_0.csv
nodes_B_2.csv
nodes_A_B_header.csv
nodes_A_B_0.csv
nodes_A_B_1.csv
nodes_A_B_2.csv
----


=== Relationships

The format of the relationship files is similar to those of the nodes.
Relationships are exported into files grouped by the relationship type.
The naming schema of the exported files is: `relationships_TYPE_INDEX.csv`, where:

- `TYPE` is the relationship type
- `INDEX` is a number between 0 and concurrency.

For each relationship type one or more data files are created, as each exporter thread exports into a separate file.

Additionally, each relationship type produces a single header file, which contains a single line describing the columns in the data files.

For example a Graph with the relationship types `:KNOWS`, `:LIVES_IN` might create the following files

----
relationships_KNOWS_header.csv
relationships_KNOWS_0.csv
relationships_LIVES_IN_header.csv
relationships_LIVES_IN_0.csv
relationships_LIVES_IN_2.csv
----

== Example

.Export the `my-graph` from GDS into a directory `my-export`:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.beta.graph.export.csv('my-graph', { exportName: 'my-export' })
----


== Example with additional node properties

Suppose we have a graph `my-db-graph` in the Neo4j database that has a string node property `myproperty`, and that we have a corresponding in-memory graph called `my-in-memory-graph` which does not have the `myproperty` node property.
If we want to export `my-in-memory-graph` but additionally add the `myproperty` properties from `my-db-graph` we can use the `additionalProperties` configuration parameter.

.Export the `my-in-memory-graph` from GDS with the `myproperty` from `my-db-graph` into a directory `my-export`:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.beta.graph.export.csv('my-graph', { exportName: 'my-export', additionalNodeProperties: ['myproperty']})
----

[NOTE]
====
The original database (`my-db-graph`) must not have changed since loading the in-memory representation (`my-in-memory-graph`) that we export in order for the export to work correctly.
====

The `additionalNodeProperties` parameter uses the same syntax as `nodeProperties` of the xref:management-ops/graph-creation/graph-project.adoc[graph project procedure].
So we could for instance define a default value for our `myproperty`.

.Export the `my-in-memory-graph` from GDS with `myproperty` from `my-db-graph` with default value into a directory called `my-export`:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.beta.graph.export.csv('my-graph', { exportName: 'my-export', additionalNodeProperties: [{ myproperty: {defaultValue: 'my-default-value'}}] })
----
