= Publishing models

By default, a trained model is visible to the user that created it.
Making a model accessible to other users can be achieved by publishing it.

== Examples

[role=query-example]
--
.Publishing trained model:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.alpha.model.publish('my-model')
YIELD modelInfo, loaded, shared, stored
RETURN modelInfo.modelName AS modelName, shared
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| modelName          | shared
| "my-model_public"  | true
|===

We can see that the model is now shared. 
The shared model has the `_public` suffix.
