== Introduction

Sometimes, we might require a spanning tree(a tree where its nodes are connected with each via a single path) that does not necessarily span all nodes in the graph.
The K-Spanning tree heuristic algorithm returns a tree with `k` nodes and `k âˆ’ 1` relationships.
Our heuristic processes the result found by Prim's algorithm for the  xref:algorithms/minimum-weight-spanning-tree.adoc[Minimum Weight Spanning Tree] problem.
Like Prim, it starts from a given source node, finds a spanning tree for all nodes and then removes nodes using heuristics to produce a tree with 'k' nodes.
Note that the source node will not be necessarily included in the final output as the heuristic tries to find a globally good tree.

== Considerations
The Minimum weight k-Spanning Tree is NP-Hard. The algorithm in the Neo4j GDS Library is therefore not guaranteed to find the optimal answer, but should hopefully return a good approximation in practice.

Like Prim algorithm, the algorithm focuses only on the component of the source node. If that component has fewer than `k` nodes, it will not look into other components, but will instead return the component.

=== Minimum K-Spanning Tree example

In our sample graph we have 7 nodes.
By setting the `k=3`, we define that we want to find a 3-minimum spanning tree that covers 3 nodes and has 2 relationships.

.The following will run the k-minimum spanning tree algorithm and write back results:
[role=query-example, no-result=true, group=write-example]
--
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
MATCH (n:Place{id: 'A'})
CALL gds.alpha.kSpanningTree.write('graph', {
  k: 3,
  sourceNode: id(n),
  relationshipWeightProperty: 'cost',
  writeProperty:'kmin'
})
YIELD preProcessingMillis, computeMillis, writeMillis, effectiveNodeCount
RETURN preProcessingMillis,computeMillis,writeMillis, effectiveNodeCount;
----
--

[role=query-example, group=write-example]

.The following will find the nodes that belong to our k-spanning tree result:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
MATCH (n)
WITH n.kmin AS p, count(n) AS c
WHERE c = 3
MATCH (n)
WHERE n.kmin = p
RETURN n.id As Place, p as Partition
