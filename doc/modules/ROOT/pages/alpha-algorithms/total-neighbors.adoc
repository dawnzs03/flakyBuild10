= Total Neighbors
:description: This section describes the Total Neighbors algorithm in the Neo4j Graph Data Science library.


Total Neighbors computes the closeness of nodes, based on the number of unique neighbors that they have.
It is based on the idea that the more connected a node is, the more likely it is to receive new links.

[[algorithms-linkprediction-total-neighbors-context]]
== History and explanation

Total Neighbors is computed using the following formula:

image::equations/total-neighbors.svg[role="middle"]

where `N(x)` is the set of nodes adjacent to `x`, and `N(y)` is the set of nodes adjacent to `y`.

A value of 0 indicates that two nodes are not close, while higher values indicate nodes are closer.

The library contains a function to calculate the closeness between two nodes.

== Syntax

.The following will run the algorithm and return the result:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
RETURN gds.alpha.linkprediction.totalNeighbors(node1:Node, node2:Node, {
    relationshipQuery: null,
    direction: "BOTH"
})
----


.Parameters
[opts="header",cols="1,1,1,1,4"]
|===
| Name                | Type   | Default | Optional | Description
| `node1`             | Node   | null    | no       | A node
| `node2`             | Node   | null    | no       | Another node
| `relationshipQuery` | String | null    | yes      | The relationship type used to compute similarity between `node1` and `node2`
| `direction`         | String | BOTH    | yes      | The relationship direction used to compute similarity between `node1` and `node2`. Possible values are `OUTGOING`, `INCOMING` and `BOTH`.

[[algorithms-linkprediction-total-neighbors-sample]]
== Total Neighbors algorithm sample

.The following will create a sample graph:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CREATE (zhen:Person {name: 'Zhen'}),
       (praveena:Person {name: 'Praveena'}),
       (michael:Person {name: 'Michael'}),
       (arya:Person {name: 'Arya'}),
       (karin:Person {name: 'Karin'}),

       (zhen)-[:FRIENDS]->(arya),
       (zhen)-[:FRIENDS]->(praveena),
       (praveena)-[:WORKS_WITH]->(karin),
       (praveena)-[:FRIENDS]->(michael),
       (michael)-[:WORKS_WITH]->(karin),
       (arya)-[:FRIENDS]->(karin)
----

.The following will return the Total Neighbors score for Michael and Karin:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
MATCH (p1:Person {name: 'Michael'})
MATCH (p2:Person {name: 'Karin'})
RETURN gds.alpha.linkprediction.totalNeighbors(p1, p2) AS score
----

.Results
[opts="header",cols="1"]
|===
| `score`
| 4.0
|===

We can also compute the score of a pair of nodes, based on a specific relationship type.

.The following will return the Total Neighbors score for Michael and Karin based only on the `FRIENDS` relationship:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
MATCH (p1:Person {name: 'Michael'})
MATCH (p2:Person {name: 'Karin'})
RETURN gds.alpha.linkprediction.totalNeighbors(p1, p2, {relationshipQuery: "FRIENDS"}) AS score
----

.Results
[opts="header",cols="1"]
|===
| `score`
| 2.0
