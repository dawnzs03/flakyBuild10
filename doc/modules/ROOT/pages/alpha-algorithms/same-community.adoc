:description: This section describes the Same Community algorithm in the Neo4j Graph Data Science library.


Same Community is a way of determining whether two nodes belong to the same community.
These communities could be computed by using one of the xref:algorithms/community.adoc[Community detection].

[[algorithms-linkprediction-same-community-context]]
== History and explanation

If two nodes belong to the same community, there is a greater likelihood that there will be a relationship between them in future, if there isn't already.

A value of 0 indicates that two nodes are not in the same community.
A value of 1 indicates that two nodes are in the same community.

The library contains a function to calculate closeness between two nodes.


[[algorithms-linkprediction-same-community-syntax]]
== Syntax

.The following will run the algorithm and return the result:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
RETURN gds.alpha.linkprediction.sameCommunity(node1:Node, node2:Node, communityProperty:String)
----


.Parameters
[opts="header",cols="1,1,1,1,4"]
|===
| Name                | Type   | Default     | Optional | Description
| `node1`             | Node   | null        | no       | A node
| `node2`             | Node   | null        | no       | Another node
| `communityProperty` | String | 'community' | yes      | The property that contains the community to which nodes belong

[[algorithms-linkprediction-same-community-sample]]
== Same Community algorithm sample

.The following will create a sample graph:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CREATE (zhen:Person {name: 'Zhen', community: 1}),
       (praveena:Person {name: 'Praveena', community: 2}),
       (michael:Person {name: 'Michael', community: 1}),
       (arya:Person {name: 'Arya', partition: 5}),
       (karin:Person {name: 'Karin', partition: 5}),
       (jennifer:Person {name: 'Jennifer'})
----

.The following will indicate that Michael and Zhen belong to the same community:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
MATCH (p1:Person {name: 'Michael'})
MATCH (p2:Person {name: 'Zhen'})
RETURN gds.alpha.linkprediction.sameCommunity(p1, p2) AS score
----

.Results
[opts="header",cols="1"]
|===
| `score`
| 1.0
|===

.The following will indicate that Michael and Praveena do not belong to the same community:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
MATCH (p1:Person {name: 'Michael'})
MATCH (p2:Person {name: 'Praveena'})
RETURN gds.alpha.linkprediction.sameCommunity(p1, p2) AS score
----

.Results
[opts="header",cols="1"]
|===
| `score`
| 0.0
|===

If one of the nodes doesn't have a community, this means it doesn't belong to the same community as any other node.

.The following will indicate that Michael and Jennifer do not belong to the same community:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
MATCH (p1:Person {name: 'Michael'})
MATCH (p2:Person {name: 'Jennifer'})
RETURN gds.alpha.linkprediction.sameCommunity(p1, p2) AS score
----

.Results
[opts="header",cols="1"]
|===
| `score`
| 0.0
|===

By default, the community is read from the `community` property, but it is possible to explicitly state which property to read from.


.The following will indicate that Arya and Karin belong to the same community, based on the `partition` property:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
MATCH (p1:Person {name: 'Arya'})
MATCH (p2:Person {name: 'Karin'})
RETURN gds.alpha.linkprediction.sameCommunity(p1, p2, 'partition') AS score
----

.Results
[opts="header",cols="1"]
|===
| `score`
| 1.0
|===
