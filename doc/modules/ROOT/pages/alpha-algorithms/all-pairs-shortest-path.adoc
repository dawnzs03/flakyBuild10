= All Pairs Shortest Path
:description: This section describes the All Pairs Shortest Path algorithm in the Neo4j Graph Data Science library.


The All Pairs Shortest Path (APSP) calculates the shortest (weighted) path between all pairs of nodes.
This algorithm has optimizations that make it quicker than calling the Single Source Shortest Path algorithm for every pair of nodes in the graph.

[[algorithm-all-pairs-shortest-path-context]]
== History and explanation

// tag::explanation[]
Some pairs of nodes might not be reachable between each other, so no shortest path exists between these pairs.
In this scenario, the algorithm will return `Infinity` value as a result between these pairs of nodes.
// end::explanation[]

GDS includes xref:management-ops/utility-functions.adoc[functions] such as  `gds.util.isFinite` to help filter infinity values from results.
Starting with Neo4j 5, the `Infinity` literal is now included in Cypher too.


[[algorithm-all-pairs-shortest-path-usecase]]
== Use-cases - when to use the All Pairs Shortest Path algorithm

// tag::use-case[]

* The All Pairs Shortest Path algorithm is used in urban service system problems, such as the location of urban facilities or the distribution or delivery of goods.
  One example of this is determining the traffic load expected on different segments of a transportation grid.
  For more information, see http://web.mit.edu/urban_or_book/www/book/[Urban Operations Research^].
* All pairs shortest path is used as part of the REWIRE data center design algorithm that finds a network with maximum bandwidth and minimal latency.
  There are more details about this approach in https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/research/tr/2011/CS-2011-21.pdf["REWIRE: An Optimization-based Framework for Data Center Network Design"^]
