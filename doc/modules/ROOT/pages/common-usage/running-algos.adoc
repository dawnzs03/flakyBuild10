:description: This section describes the common execution modes for algorithms: `stream`, `stats`, `mutate` and `write`.


All algorithms are exposed as Neo4j procedures.
They can be called directly from Cypher using Neo4j Browser, `cypher-shell`, or from your client code using a Neo4j Driver in the language of your choice.

For a detailed guide on the syntax to run algorithms, please see the xref:algorithms/syntax.adoc[Syntax overview] section.
In short, algorithms are run using one of the execution modes `stream`, `stats`, `mutate` or `write`, which we cover in this chapter.

The execution of any algorithm can be canceled by terminating the Cypher transaction that is executing the procedure call.
For more on how transactions are used, see xref:production-deployment/transaction-handling.adoc[Transaction Handling].


[[running-algos-stream]]
== Stream

The `stream` mode will return the results of the algorithm computation as Cypher result rows.
This is similar to how standard Cypher reading queries operate.

The returned data can be a node ID and a computed value for the node (such as a Page Rank score, or WCC componentId), or two node IDs and a computed value for the node pair (such as a Node Similarity similarity score).

If the graph is very large, the result of a `stream` mode computation will also be very large.
Using the `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` subclauses in the Cypher query could be useful to support 'top N'-style use cases.


[[running-algos-stats]]
== Stats

The `stats` mode returns statistical results for the algorithm computation like counts or percentile distributions.
A statistical summary of the computation is returned as a single Cypher result row.
The direct results of the algorithm are not available when using the `stats` mode.
This mode forms the basis of the `mutate` and `write` execution modes but does not attempt to make any modifications or updates anywhere.


[[running-algos-mutate]]
== Mutate

The `mutate` mode will write the results of the algorithm computation back to the projected graph.
Note that the specified `mutateProperty` value must not exist in the projected graph beforehand.
This enables running multiple algorithms on the same projected graph without writing results to Neo4j in-between algorithm executions.

This execution mode is especially useful in three scenarios:

* Algorithms can depend on the results of previous algorithms without the need to write to Neo4j.
* Algorithm results can be written altogether (see xref:management-ops/graph-write-to-neo4j/write-back-to-nodes.adoc#catalog-graph-write-node-properties-example[write node properties] and xref:management-ops/graph-write-to-neo4j/write-back-relationships.adoc#catalog-graph-write-relationship-example[write relationships]).
* Algorithm results can be queried via Cypher without the need to write to Neo4j at all (see xref:management-ops/index.adoc#_read[Reading graphs]).

A statistical summary of the computation is returned similar to the `stats` mode.
Mutated data can be node properties (such as Page Rank scores), new relationships (such as Node Similarity similarities), or relationship properties.


[[running-algos-write]]
== Write

The `write` mode will write the results of the algorithm computation back to the Neo4j database.
This is similar to how standard Cypher writing queries operate.
A statistical summary of the computation is returned similar to the `stats` mode.
This is the only execution mode that will attempt to make modifications to the Neo4j database.

The written data can be node properties (such as Page Rank scores), new relationships (such as Node Similarity similarities), or relationship properties.
The `write` mode can be very useful for use cases where the algorithm results would be inspected multiple times by separate queries since the computational results are handled entirely by the library.

In order for the results from a `write` mode computation to be used by another algorithm, a new graph must be projected from the Neo4j database with the updated graph.

[[algorithms-syntax-configuration-parameters]]
== Common Configuration parameters

All algorithms allow adjustment of their runtime characteristics through a set of configuration parameters.
Although some parameters are algorithm-specific, many are shared between algorithms and execution modes.

[NOTE]
To learn more about algorithm specific parameters and to find out if an algorithm supports a certain parameter, please consult the algorithm-specific documentation page.

.List of the most commonly accepted configuration parameters
[[common-configuration-concurrency]]
concurrency - Integer::
Controls the parallelism with which the algorithm is executed.
By default this value is set to 4.
For more details on the concurrency settings and limitations please see xref:installation/System-requirements.adoc#system-requirements-cpu[the CPU section] of the System Requirements.

[[common-configuration-node-labels]]
nodeLabels - List of String::
If the graph, on which the algorithm is run, was projected with multiple node label projections, this parameter can be used to select only a subset of the projected labels.
The algorithm will only consider nodes with any of the selected labels.

[[common-configuration-relationship-types]]
relationshipTypes - List of String::
If the graph, on which the algorithm is run, was projected with multiple relationship type projections, this parameter can be used to select only a subset of the projected types.
The algorithm will only consider relationships with any of the selected types.

[[common-configuration-node-weight-property]]
nodeWeightProperty - String::
In algorithms that support node weights this parameter defines the node property that contains the weights.

[[common-configuration-relationship-weight-property]]
relationshipWeightProperty - String::
In algorithms that support relationship weights this parameter defines the relationship property that contains the weights.
The specified property is required to exist in the specified graph on all specified xref:common-usage/running-algos.adoc#common-configuration-relationship-types[relationship types].
The values must be numeric, and some algorithms may have additional value restrictions, such as requiring only positive weights.

[[common-configuration-max-iterations]]
maxIterations - Integer::
For iterative algorithms this parameter controls the maximum number of iterations.

[[common-configuration-tolerance]]
tolerance - Float::
Many iterative algorithms accept the tolerance parameter.
It controls the minimum delta between two iterations.
If the delta is less than the tolerance value, the algorithm is considered converged and stops.

[[common-configuration-seed-property]]
seedProperty - String::
Some algorithms can be calculated incrementally.
This means that results from a previous execution can be taken into account, even though the graph has changed.
The `seedProperty` parameter defines the node property that contains the seed value.
Seeding can speed up computation and write times.

[[common-configuration-write-property]]
writeProperty - String::
In `write` mode this parameter sets the name of the node or relationship property to which results are written.
If the property already exists, existing values will be overwritten.

[[common-configuration-write-concurrency]]
writeConcurrency - Integer::
In `write` mode this parameter controls the parallelism of write operations.
The Default is `concurrency`

[[common-configuration-jobid]]
jobId - String::
An id for the job to be started can be provided in order for it to be more easily tracked with eg. GDS's xref:common-usage/logging.adoc[logging capabilities].

[[common-configuration-logProgress]]
logProgress - Boolean::
Configuration parameter that allows to turn `off/on` percentage logging while running procedure. It is `on` by default
