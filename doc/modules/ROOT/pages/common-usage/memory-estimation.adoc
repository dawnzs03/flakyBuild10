= Memory Estimation
:description: This section describes how to estimate memory requirements for the projected graph model used by the Neo4j Graph Data Science library.


The graph algorithms library operates completely on the heap, which means we'll need to configure our Neo4j Server with a much larger heap size than we would for transactional workloads.
The diagram belows shows how memory is used by the projected graph model:

image::graph-model-memory.png[width=500]

The model contains three types of data:

* Node ids - up to 2^45^ ("35 trillion")
* Relationships - pairs of node ids. Relationships are stored twice if `orientation: "UNDIRECTED"` is used.
* Weights - stored as doubles (8 bytes per node) in an array-like data structure next to the relationships

Memory configuration depends on the graph projection that we're using.

== Estimating memory requirements for algorithms

In many use cases it will be useful to estimate the required memory of projecting a graph and running an algorithm _before_ running it in order to make sure that the workload can run on the available free memory.
To do this the `.estimate` mode can be used, which returns an estimate of the amount of memory required to run graph algorithms.
Note that only algorithms in the production-ready tier are guaranteed to have an `.estimate` mode.
For more details please refer to xref:algorithms/syntax.adoc[Syntax overview].

.Parameters
[opts="header",cols="1,1,1,1,4"]
|===
| Name              | Type          | Default   | Optional  | Description
| graphNameOrConfig | String or Map | -         | no        | The name of the projected graph or a xref:common-usage/memory-estimation.adoc#estimate-procedure-graph-project-config[configuration to project a graph].
| configuration     | Map           | -         | no        | The configuration of the algorithm.
|===

The configuration map accepts the same configuration parameters as the estimated algorithm.
See the specific algorithm documentation for more information.

In contrast to procedures that execute algorithms, for memory estimation it is possible to define a xref:common-usage/memory-estimation.adoc#estimate-procedure-graph-project-config[graph projection config].
With this it is possible to measure the memory consumption of projecting a graph and executing the algorithm at the same time.

[[estimate-procedure-graph]]
== Estimating memory requirements for graphs

The xref:management-ops/graph-creation/graph-project.adoc[`gds.graph.project`] procedures also support `.estimate` to estimate memory usage for just the graph.
Those procedures don't accept the graph name as the first argument, as they don't actually project the graph.

.Syntax
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.graph.project.estimate(nodeProjection: String|List|Map, relationshipProjection: String|List|Map, configuration: Map)
YIELD requiredMemory, treeView, mapView, bytesMin, bytesMax, heapPercentageMin, heapPercentageMax, nodeCount, relationshipCount
----

The `nodeProjection` and `relationshipProjection` parameters follow the same syntax as in xref:management-ops/graph-creation/graph-project.adoc[`gds.graph.project`].

.Parameters
[opts="header",cols="1,1,1,1,4"]
|===
| Name                   | Type                  | Default   | Optional  | Description
| nodeProjection         | String or List or Map | -         | no        | The node projection to estimate for.
| relationshipProjection | String or List or Map | -         | no        | The relationship projection to estimate for.
| configuration          | Map                   | {}        | yes       | Additional configuration, such as concurrency.
|===

The result of running `gds.graph.project.estimate` has the same form as the algorithm memory estimation results above.

[[estimate-procedure-fictive-graph]]
It is also possible to estimate the memory of a fictive graph, by explicitly specifying its node and relationship count.
Using this feature, one can estimate the memory consumption of an arbitrarily sized graph.

To achieve this, use the following configuration options:

.Configuration
[opts="header",cols="1,1,1,1,4"]
|===
| Name              | Type      | Default           | Optional  | Description
| nodeCount         | Integer   | 0                 | yes       | The number of nodes in a fictive graph.
| relationshipCount | Integer   | 0                 | yes       | The number of relationships in a fictive graph.
|===

When estimating a fictive graph, syntactically valid `nodeProjection` and `relationshipProjection` must be specified.
However, it is recommended to specify `'*'` for both in the fictive graph case as this does not interfere with the specified values above.

The query below is an example of estimating a fictive graph with 100 nodes and 1000 relationships.

.Example
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.graph.project.estimate('*', '*', {
  nodeCount: 100,
  relationshipCount: 1000,
  nodeProperties: 'foo',
  relationshipProperties: 'bar'
})
YIELD requiredMemory, treeView, mapView, bytesMin, bytesMax, nodeCount, relationshipCount
----

.Results
[opts="header",cols="2,1,1,1,1"]
|===
| requiredMemory          | bytesMin | bytesMax | nodeCount | relationshipCount
| "593 KiB" | 607576   | 607576   | 100       | 1000
|===

The xref:management-ops/graph-creation/graph-project-cypher-legacy.adoc[`gds.graph.project.cypher`] procedure has to execute both, the `nodeQuery` and `relationshipQuery`, in order to count the number of nodes and relationships of the graph.

.Syntax
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.graph.project.cypher.estimate(nodeQuery: String, relationshipQuery: String, configuration: Map)
YIELD requiredMemory, treeView, mapView, bytesMin, bytesMax, heapPercentageMin, heapPercentageMax, nodeCount, relationshipCount
----

.Parameters
[opts="header",cols="1,1,1,1,4"]
|===
| Name              | Type   | Default   | Optional  | Description
| nodeQuery         | String | -         | no        | The node query to estimate for.
| relationshipQuery | String | -         | no        | The relationship query to estimate for.
| configuration     | Map    | {}        | yes       | Additional configuration, such as concurrency.

[[estimate-heap-control]]
== Automatic estimation and execution blocking

All procedures in the GDS library that support estimation, including graph creation, will do an estimation check at the beginning of their execution.
This includes all execution modes, but not the `estimate` procedures themselves.

If the estimation check can determine that the current amount of free memory is insufficient to carry through the operation, the operation will be aborted and an error will be reported.
The error will contain details of the estimation and the free memory at the time of estimation.

This heap control logic is restrictive in the sense that it only blocks executions that are certain to not fit into memory.
It does not guarantee that an execution that passed the heap control will succeed without depleting memory.
Thus, it is still useful to first run the estimation mode before running an algorithm or graph creation on a large data set, in order to view all details of the estimation.

The free memory taken into consideration is based on the Java runtime system information.
The amount of free memory can be increased by either xref:management-ops/graph-drop.adoc[dropping] unused graphs from the catalog, or by xref:installation/System-requirements.adoc#heap-size[increasing the maximum heap size] prior to starting the Neo4j instance.

[[bypass-heap-control]]
=== Bypassing heap control

Occasionally you will want the ability to bypass heap control if it is too restrictive. You might have insights into how your particular procedure call will behave, memory-wise; or you might just want to take a chance e.g. because the memory estimate you received is very close to system limits.

For that use case we have _sudo mode_ which allows you to manually skip heap control and run your procedure regardless. Sudo mode is off by default to protect users - we fail fast if we can see your potentially long-running procedure would not be able to complete successfully.

To enable sudo mode, add the sudo parameter when calling a procedure. Here is an example of calling the popular Louvain community detection algorithm in sudo mode:

[role=query-example]
--
.Run Louvain in sudo mode:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.louvain.write('myGraph', { writeProperty: 'community', sudo: true })
YIELD communityCount, modularity, modularities
----
--

Accidentally enabling sudo mode when calling a procedure, causing it to run out of memory, will not significantly damage your installation, but it will waste your time.
