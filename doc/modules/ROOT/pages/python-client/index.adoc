:description: This chapter introduces the dedicated Python Client for Neo4j Graph Data Science.


To help users of GDS who work with Python as their primary language and environment, there is an official Neo4j GDS client package called `graphdatascience`.
It enables users to write pure Python code to project graphs, run algorithms, and define and use machine learning pipelines in GDS.

The Python client API is designed to mimic the GDS Cypher procedure API in Python code.
It wraps and abstracts the necessary operations of the https://neo4j.com/docs/python-manual/current/[Neo4j Python driver] to offer a simpler surface.

Please see https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science-client/[the GDS Python Client manual] for the full documentation of the client.
