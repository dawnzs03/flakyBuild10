[[algorithms-sllpa-intro]]
== Introduction

The Speaker-Listener Label Propagation Algorithm (SLLPA) is a variation of the Label Propagation algorithm that is able to detect multiple communities per node.
The GDS implementation is based on the https://arxiv.org/pdf/1109.5720.pdf[SLPA: Uncovering Overlapping Communities in Social Networks via A Speaker-listener Interaction Dynamic Process] publication by Xie et al.

The algorithm is randomized in nature and will not produce deterministic results.
To accommodate this, we recommend using a higher number of iterations.

== Examples

:algorithm-name: {algorithm}

include::partial$/algorithms/shared/examples-intro.adoc[]

.The following Cypher statement will create the example graph in the Neo4j database:
[source, cypher, role=noplay setup-query]
----
CREATE
  (a:Person {name: 'Alice'}),
  (b:Person {name: 'Bob'}),
  (c:Person {name: 'Carol'}),
  (d:Person {name: 'Dave'}),
  (e:Person {name: 'Eve'}),
  (f:Person {name: 'Fredrick'}),
  (g:Person {name: 'Gary'}),
  (h:Person {name: 'Hilda'}),
  (i:Person {name: 'Ichabod'}),
  (j:Person {name: 'James'}),
  (k:Person {name: 'Khalid'}),

  (a)-[:KNOWS]->(b),
  (a)-[:KNOWS]->(c),
  (a)-[:KNOWS]->(d),
  (b)-[:KNOWS]->(c),
  (b)-[:KNOWS]->(d),
  (c)-[:KNOWS]->(d),

  (b)-[:KNOWS]->(e),
  (e)-[:KNOWS]->(f),
  (f)-[:KNOWS]->(g),
  (g)-[:KNOWS]->(h),

  (h)-[:KNOWS]->(i),
  (h)-[:KNOWS]->(j),
  (h)-[:KNOWS]->(k),
  (i)-[:KNOWS]->(j),
  (i)-[:KNOWS]->(k),
  (j)-[:KNOWS]->(k);
----

In the example, we will use the SLLPA algorithm to find the communities in the graph.

.The following statement will project the graph and store it in the graph catalog.
[source, cypher, role=noplay graph-project-query]
----
CALL gds.graph.project(
  'myGraph',
  'Person',
  {
    KNOWS: {
      orientation: 'UNDIRECTED'
    }
  }
);
----

In the following examples we will demonstrate using the SLLPA algorithm on this graph.


[[algorithms-sllpa-examples-stream]]
=== Stream

In the `stream` execution mode, the algorithm returns the {result} for each node.
This allows us to inspect the results directly or post-process them in Cypher without any side effects.

For more details on the `stream` mode in general, see xref:common-usage/running-algos.adoc#running-algos-stream[Stream].

[role=query-example, no-result=true]

.The following will run the algorithm, and stream results:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.alpha.sllpa.stream('myGraph', {maxIterations: 100, minAssociationStrength: 0.1})
YIELD nodeId, values
RETURN gds.util.asNode(nodeId).name AS Name, values.communityIds AS communityIds
  ORDER BY Name ASC
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| Name       | communityIds
| "Alice"    | [0]
| "Bob"      | [0]
| "Carol"    | [0]
| "Dave"     | [0]
| "Eve"      | [0, 1]
| "Fredrick" | [0, 1]
| "Gary"     | [0, 1]
| "Hilda"    | [1]
| "Ichabod"  | [1]
| "James"    | [1]
| "Khalid"   | [1]
|===

Due to the randomness of the algorithm, the results will tend to vary between runs.
