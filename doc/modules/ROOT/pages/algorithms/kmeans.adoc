[[algorithms-k-means-intro]]
== Introduction

K-Means clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm that is used to solve clustering problems.
It follows a simple procedure of classifying a given data set into a number of clusters, defined by the parameter `k`.
The Neo4j GDS Library conducts clustering based on node properties, with a float array node property being passed as input via the `nodeProperty` parameter.
Nodes in the graph are then positioned as points in a `d`-dimensional space (where `d` is the length of the array property).

The algorithm then begins by selecting `k` initial cluster centroids, which are `d`-dimensional arrays (see xref:algorithms-kmeans-sampling[section below] for more details).
The centroids act as representatives for a cluster.

Then, all nodes in the graph calculate their Euclidean distance from each of the cluster centroids and are assigned to the cluster of minimum distance from them.
 After these assignments, each cluster takes the mean of all nodes (as points) assigned to it to form its new representative centroid (as a `d`-dimensional array).

The process repeats with the new centroids until results stabilize, i.e., only a few nodes change clusters per iteration or the number of maximum iterations is reached.

Note that the K-Means implementation ignores relationships as it is only focused on node properties.

For more information on this algorithm, see:

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering

[[algorithms-kmeans-sampling]]
== Initial Centroid Sampling

The algorithm starts by picking `k` centroids by randomly sampling from the set of available nodes.
There are two different sampling strategies.

Uniform::

With uniform sampling, each node has the same probability to be picked as one of the `k` initial centroids.
This is the default sampler for K-Means denoted with the `uniform` parameter.

K-Means++::

This sampling strategy adapts the well-known K-means\++ initialization algorithmfootnote:[Arthur, David and Sergei Vassilvitskii. "k-means{plus}{plus}: The Advantages of Careful Seeding." _ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms_ (2007).] for K-Means.
The sampling begins by choosing the first centroid uniformly at random.
Then, the remaining `k-1` centroids are picked one-by-one based on weighted random sampling.
That is, the probability a node is chosen as the next centroid is proportional to its minimum distance from the already picked centroids.
Nodes with larger distance hence have higher chance to be picked as a centroid.
This sampling strategy tries to spread the initial clusters more evenly so as to obtain a better final clustering. This option can be enabled by choosing `kmeans++` as the initial sampler in the configuration.


It is also possible to explicitly give the list of initial centroids to the algorithm via the `seedCentroids` parameter. In this case, the value of the `initialSampler` parameter is ignored, even if changed in the configuration.

[[algorithm-k-means-considerations]]
== Considerations

In order for K-Means to work properly, the property arrays for all nodes must have the same number of elements. Also, they should contain exclusively numbers and not contain any NaN values.

Notice that in this case the cities have been geographically clustered into two clusters: one contains cities in Northern Europe whereas the other contains in Southern Europe.
On the other hand, the cluster with New York as the initial centroid was not the closest to any city at the first phase.
