[[algorithms-leiden-intro]]
== Introduction

The Leiden algorithm is an algorithm for detecting communities in large networks.
The algorithm separates nodes into disjoint communities so as to maximize a modularity score for each community.
Modularity quantifies the quality of an assignment of nodes to communities, that is how densely connected nodes in a community are, compared to how connected they would be in a random network.

The Leiden algorithm is a hierarchical clustering algorithm, that recursively merges communities into single nodes by greedily optimizing the modularity and the process repeats in the condensed graph.
It modifies the xref:algorithms/louvain.adoc[Louvain] algorithm to address some of its shortcomings, namely the case where some of the communities found by Louvain are not well-connected.
This is achieved by periodically randomly breaking down communities into smaller well-connected ones.

For more information on this algorithm, see:

* https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.08473.pdf[V.A. Traag, L. Waltman and N.J. van Eck "From Louvain to Leiden: guaranteeing well-connected communities"^]

[NOTE]
====
Running this algorithm requires sufficient memory availability.
Before running this algorithm, we recommend that you read xref:common-usage/memory-estimation.adoc[Memory Estimation].

This graph has two clusters of _Users_, that are closely connected.
These clusters are connected by a single edge.
The relationship property `weight`  determines the strength of each respective relationship between nodes.

We can now project the graph and store it in the graph catalog.
We load the `LINK` relationships with orientation set to `UNDIRECTED` as this works best with the Leiden algorithm.

| "Charles" | 2

| "Michael" | 5
|===
--

Using the weighted relationships, we see that `Alice` and `Doug` have formed their own community, as their link is much stronger than all the others.

=== Using intermediate communities

As described before, Leiden is a hierarchical clustering algorithm.
That means that after every clustering step all nodes that belong to the same cluster are reduced to a single node.
Relationships between nodes of the same cluster become self-relationships, relationships to nodes of other clusters connect to the clusters representative.
This condensed graph is then used to run the next level of clustering.
The process is repeated until the clusters are stable.

In order to demonstrate this iterative behavior, we need to construct a more complex graph.

[[algorithms-leiden-examples-stream-seeded]]
=== Seeded

It is possible to run the  Louvain algorithm incrementally, by providing a seed property.
If specified, the seed property provides an initial community mapping for a subset of the loaded nodes.
The algorithm will try to keep the seeded community IDs.

[role=query-example]
--
.The following will run the algorithm and stream results for a seeded graph:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.leiden.stream('myGraph', { seedProperty: 'seed' })
YIELD nodeId, communityId, intermediateCommunityIds
RETURN gds.util.asNode(nodeId).name AS name, communityId, intermediateCommunityIds
ORDER BY name ASC
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| name      | communityId | intermediateCommunityIds
| "Alice"   | 42          | null
| "Bridget" | 42          | null
| "Charles" | 42          | null
| "Doug"    | 45          | null
| "Mark"    | 45          | null
| "Michael" | 45          | null
|===
--

As can be seen, using the seeded graph, node `Alice` keeps its initial community ID of `42`.
The other community has been assigned a new community ID which is guaranteed to be larger than the largest seeded community ID.
Note that the `consecutiveIds` configuration option cannot be used in combination with seeding in order to retain the seeding values
