[[algorithms-k-core-intro]]
== Introduction

The K-core decomposition constitutes a process of separates the nodes in a graph into groups based on the degree sequence and topology of the graph.

The term `i-core` refers to a maximal subgraph of the original graph such that each node in this subgraph has degree at least `i`.
The maximality ensures that it is not possible to find another subgraph with more nodes where this degree property holds.

The nodes in the subgraph denoted by `i-core` also belong to the subgraph denoted by `j-core` for any `j<i`.
The converse however is not true.
Each node  _u_  is associated with a core value which denotes the largest value _i_ such that _u_ belongs to the `i-core`.
The largest core value is called the _degeneracy_ of the graph.

Standard algorithms for K-Core Decomposition  iteratively remove the node of lowest degree until the graph becomes empty.
When a node is removed from the graph, all of its relationships are removed, and the degree of its neighbors is reduced by one.
With this approach, the different core groups are discovered one-by-one.

The Neo4j GDS Library offers a parallel implementation based on two recent approaches for the problem:

https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7965211/[Parallel k-core decomposition on multicore platforms]

https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7004366/[ParK: An efficient algorithm for k-core decomposition on multicore processors]

K-core Decomposition can have applications in several fields ranging from social network analysis to bioinformatics.
Some of the possible use-cases are presented https://doc.rero.ch/record/328037/files/zha_kct.pdf[here].

.The following Cypher statement will create the example graph in the Neo4j database:

With the graph in Neo4j we can now project it into the graph catalog to prepare it for algorithm execution.
We do this using a native projection targeting the `User` nodes and the `FRIEND` relationships.

include::partial$/algorithms/shared/examples-named-native-note.adoc[]

.The following statement will project a graph using athe undirected projection and store it in the graph catalog under the name 'graph'.
[source, cypher, role=noplay graph-project-query]
----
CALL gds.graph.project(
  'graph',
  'User',
  {
    FRIEND: {
      orientation: 'UNDIRECTED'
    }
  }
)
----

The graph is projected in the  `UNDIRECTED` orientation  as the friendship relationship is associative.

[[algorithms-k-core-examples-stream]]
=== Stream

:stream-details: For example, we can order the results to find the nodes with the highest core values.
include::partial$/algorithms/shared/examples-stream-intro.adoc[]

[role=query-example]
--
.The following will run the algorithm in `stream` mode:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.kcore.stream('graph')
YIELD nodeId, coreValue
RETURN gds.util.asNode(nodeId).name AS name, coreValue
ORDER BY coreValue ASC, name DESC
----

.Results
[opts="header",cols="1,1"]
|===
| name       | coreValue
| "James"    | 1
| "Ian"      | 1
| "Bridget"  | 1
| "Alice"    | 1
| "Harry"    | 2
| "Charles"  | 2
| "Greg"     | 3
| "Filip"    | 3
| "Eli"      | 3
| "Doug"     | 3


|===
--

The algorithm has separated the nodes in the graph in three distinct groups.
The first group  where all nodes have core value qual to 1 includes James, Ian, Bridget, and Alice.
The second group includes Harry and Charles.
Here, all the nodes have core value equal to 2.
The third group includes Greg, Filip, Eli, and Doug, and all the nodes have core value equal to 3.

As it was explained in xref:algorithms-k-core-intro[introduction], nodes with core value _i_ have degree at least _i_ in the subgraph containing only nodes with core value at least _i_.
For example, although Charles has degree 3, he cannot be part of the 3-core  subgraph since one of its neighbors is Bridget from the first group of core value 1.
Once Bridget is excluded, Charles is left with a degree of 2, which acts as an upper bound on its core value.
One of its two remaining neighbors is Doug who belongs to the 3-core.

Note that as the results show, the nodes in different connected components might be part of the same core group (for example Ian and Alice).

[[algorithms-k-core-examples-stats]]
=== Stats

:stats-syntax: algorithms-k-core-syntax
include::partial$/algorithms/shared/examples-stats-intro.adoc[]

[role=query-example]
--
.The following will run the algorithm in `stats` mode:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.kcore.stats('graph')
YIELD degeneracy
RETURN degeneracy
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| degeneracy
|3
|===
--

As the results from xref:algorithms/k-core.adoc#algorithms-k-core-examples-stream[stream example] also confirm, the degeneracy, i.e., the largest core value, is equal to three.


[[algorithms-k-core-examples-mutate]]
=== Mutate

include::partial$/algorithms/shared/examples-mutate-intro.adoc[]

[role=query-example]
--
.The following will run the algorithm in `mutate` mode:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.kcore.mutate('graph', { mutateProperty: 'coreValue' })
YIELD degeneracy, nodePropertiesWritten
RETURN degeneracy , nodePropertiesWritten
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| degeneracy | nodePropertiesWritten
| 3         | 10
|===
--

The returned result is the same as in the `stats` example.
Additionally, the in-memory graph now has a node property `coreValue` which stores the core value of each node.
To find out how to inspect the new schema of the in-memory graph, see xref:management-ops/graph-list.adoc[Listing graphs in the catalog].


[[algorithms-k-core-examples-write]]
=== Write

include::partial$/algorithms/shared/examples-write-intro.adoc[]

[role=query-example]
--
.The following will run the algorithm in `write` mode:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.kcore.write('graph', { writeProperty: 'coreValue' })
YIELD degeneracy, nodePropertiesWritten
RETURN degeneracy , nodePropertiesWritten
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| degeneracy | nodePropertiesWritten
| 3         | 10
|===
--
The returned result is the same as in the `stats` example.
Additionally, each of the seven nodes now has a new property `coreValue` in the Neo4j database, containing the core value for that node.
