[[algorithms-node-similarity-intro]]
== Introduction

The Node Similarity algorithm compares a set of nodes based on the nodes they are connected to.
Two nodes are considered similar if they share many of the same neighbors.
Node Similarity computes pair-wise similarities based on either the Jaccard metric, also known as the Jaccard Similarity Score, or the Overlap coefficient, also known as the Szymkiewicz–Simpson coefficient.

Given two sets `A` and `B`, the Jaccard Similarity is computed using the following formula:

image::nodesim-formulas/jacard_nodesim.svg[role="middle"]
// This is the raw information for this image:
// // J(A,B) = ∣A ∩ B∣ / ∣(A ∪ B)∣ // = ∣A ∩ B∣ / ∣A∣ + ∣B∣ - ∣A ∩ B| //

The Overlap coefficient is computed using the following formula:

image::nodesim-formulas/overlap_nodesim.svg[role="middle"]
// This is the raw information for this image:
// // O(A,B) = ∣A ∩ B∣ / min(|A|, |B|∣

The input of this algorithm is a bipartite, connected graph containing two disjoint node sets.
Each relationship starts from a node in the first node set and ends at a node in the second node set.

The Node Similarity algorithm compares each node that has outgoing relationships with each other such node.
For every node `n`, we collect the outgoing neighborhood `N(n)` of that node, that is, all nodes `m` such that there is a relationship from `n` to `m`.
For each pair `n`, `m`, the algorithm computes a similarity for that pair that equals the outcome of the selected similarity metric for `N(n)` and `N(m)`.

Node Similarity has time complexity O(n^3^) and space complexity O(n^2^). We compute and store neighbour sets in time and space O(n^2^), then compute pairwise similarity scores in time O(n^3^).

In order to bound memory usage you can specify an explicit limit on the number of results to output per node, this is the 'topK' parameter. It can be set to any value, except 0. You will lose precision in the overall computation of course, and running time is unaffected - we still have to compute results before potentially throwing them away.

The output of the algorithm are new relationships between pairs of the first node set.
Similarity scores are expressed via relationship properties.

For more information on this algorithm, see:

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartite_graph[Bipartite graphs (Wikipedia)]

It is also possible to apply filtering on the source and/or target nodes in the produced similarity pairs. You can consider the xref:algorithms/filtered-node-similarity.adoc[filtered Node Similarity] algorithm for this purpose.

Running this algorithm requires sufficient available memory.

.The following Cypher statement will create the example graph in the Neo4j database:
[source, cypher, role=noplay setup-query]
----
CREATE
  (alice:Person {name: 'Alice'}),
  (bob:Person {name: 'Bob'}),
  (carol:Person {name: 'Carol'}),
  (dave:Person {name: 'Dave'}),

  (dave)-[:LIKES]->(guitar),
  (dave)-[:LIKES {strength: 1.5}]->(trumpet),
  (dave)-[:LIKES]->(bongos);
----

This bipartite graph has two node sets, Person nodes and Instrument nodes.
The two node sets are connected via LIKES relationships.
Each relationship starts at a Person node and ends at an Instrument node.

In the example, we want to use the Node Similarity algorithm to compare people based on the instruments they like.

The Node Similarity algorithm will only compute similarity for nodes that have a degree of at least 1.
In the example graph, the Eve node will not be compared to other Person nodes.

include::partial$/algorithms/shared/examples-named-native-note.adoc[]

.The following statement will project the graph and store it in the graph catalog.
[source, cypher, role=noplay graph-project-query]
----
CALL gds.graph.project(
    'myGraph',
    ['Person', 'Instrument'],
    {
        LIKES: {

                strength: {
                    property: 'strength',

                }
            }

We use default values for the procedure configuration parameter.
TopK is set to 10, topN is set to 0.
Because of that the result set contains the top 10 similarity scores for each node.

[NOTE]
====
If we would like to instead compare the Instruments to each other, we would then project the `LIKES` relationship type using `REVERSE` orientation.
This would return similarities for pairs of Instruments and not compute any similarities between Persons.

As we can see from the results, the number of created relationships is equal to the number of rows in the streaming example.

[NOTE]
====
The relationships that are produced by the mutation are always directed, even if the input graph is undirected.
If `a -> b` is topK for `a` and symmetrically `b -> a` is topK for `b` (or both `a -> b` and `b -> a` are topN), it appears as though an undirected relationship is produced.
However, they are just two directed relationships that have been independently produced.
====

[[algorithms-node-similarity-examples-write]]
=== Write

The `write` execution mode for each pair of nodes creates a relationship with their similarity score as a property to the Neo4j database.
The type of the new relationship is specified using the mandatory configuration parameter `writeRelationshipType`.
The name of the new property is specified using the mandatory configuration parameter `writeProperty`.
The result is a single summary row, similar to `stats`, but with some additional metrics.

For more details on the `write` mode in general, see xref:common-usage/running-algos.adoc#running-algos-write[Write].

[[algorithms-node-similarity-examples-limits]]

There are four limits that can be applied to the similarity results.
Top limits the result to the highest similarity scores.
Bottom limits the result to the lowest similarity scores.
Both top and bottom limits can apply to the result as a whole ("N"), or to the result per node ("K").

[NOTE]
====
There must always be a "K" limit, either bottomK or topK, which is a positive number.
The default value for topK and bottomK is 10.

TopK and bottomK are limits on the number of scores computed per node.
For topK, the K largest similarity scores per node are returned.

TopN and bottomN limit the number of similarity scores across all nodes.
This is a limit on the total result set, in addition to the topK or bottomK limit on the results per node.
For topN, the N largest similarity scores are returned.
For bottomN, the N smallest similarity scores are returned.
A value of 0 means no global limit is imposed and all results from topK or bottomK are returned.

[[algorithms-node-similarity-examples-degree-similarity-cutoff]]
=== Degree cutoffs  and similarity cutoff

Node Similarity can be tuned to ignore certain nodes based on degree constraints via two integer parameters named `degreeCutoff` and `upperDegreeCutoff`.
If set, `degreeCutoff`  imposes a lower limit on the degree in order for a node to be considered in the comparisons, and skips any nodes with degree below `degreeCutoff`.
if set, `upperDegreeCutoff` imposes an upper limit on the node degree, and skips any nodes with degree higher than `upperDegreeCutoff`.
The two parameters can also be combined so that only those nodes whose degree falls under a certain segment are considered.

The minimum value for both parameters is `1`.

[role=query-example]
--
.The following will ignore nodes with less than 3 LIKES relationships:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.nodeSimilarity.stream('myGraph', { degreeCutoff: 3 })
YIELD node1, node2, similarity
RETURN gds.util.asNode(node1).name AS Person1, gds.util.asNode(node2).name AS Person2, similarity
ORDER BY Person1

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| Person1 | Person2 | similarity
| "Alice" | "Dave"  | 0.5
| "Dave"  | "Alice" | 0.5
|===
--

Similarity cutoff is a lower limit for the similarity score to be present in the result.
The default value is very small (`1E-42`) to exclude results with a similarity score of 0.

[NOTE]
====
Setting similarity cutoff to 0 may yield a very large result set, increased runtime and memory consumption.

[[algorithms-node-similarity-examples-weighted]]
=== Weighted Similarity

Relationship properties can be used to modify the similarity induced by certain relationships.
Weighted node similarity has as default the weighted Jaccard similarty, according to the formula:

image::nodesim-formulas/weighted_jaccard.svg[role="middle"]

Formally, given two nodes and their weighted neighbour lists `A'` and `B'`, we extend the lists to `A` and `B`, index over the union of their neighbours `A' ∪ B'` by setting weight = 0 for any non-neighbour, and then apply the weighted Jaccard similarity.

It also supports weighted Overlap similarity, according to the formula:

image::nodesim-formulas/weighted_overlap.svg[role="middle"]


[NOTE]
====
Weighted similarity metrics are only defined for values greater or equal to 0.
====

[role=query-example]
--
.The following query will respect relationship properties in the similarity computation:
[source,cypher,role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.nodeSimilarity.stream('myGraph', { relationshipWeightProperty: 'strength', similarityCutoff: 0.3 })
YIELD node1, node2, similarity
RETURN gds.util.asNode(node1).name AS Person1, gds.util.asNode(node2).name AS Person2, similarity
ORDER BY Person1
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| Person1 | Person2 | similarity
| "Alice" | "Bob"   | 0.8
| "Alice" | "Dave"  | 0.333333333333333
| "Bob"   | "Alice" | 0.8
| "Dave"  | "Alice" | 0.333333333333333
|===
--

It can be seen that the similarity between Alice and Dave decreased (from 0.5 to 0.33) compared to the non-weighted version of this algorithm.

Alice likes Guitar, Synthesize and Bongos with strengths `(1, 1, 0.5)`.
Dave likes Guitar, Bongos and Trumpet with strengths `(1, 1, 1.5)`.
Therefore, taking Alice and Dave's neighbours, we have list of strengths for Alice as `A = (1, 1, 0.5, 0)` and for Dave `B = (1, 0, 1, 1.5)`, indexed as `Guitar, Synthesizer, Bongos, Trumpet`.

The weighted (Jaccard) node similarity of Alice and Dave is hence:

image::nodesim-formulas/weighted_jaccard_example.svg[role="middle"]


Analogously, the similarity between Alice and Bob increased (from 0.66 to 0.8) as the missing liked instrument has a lower impact on the similarity score.
