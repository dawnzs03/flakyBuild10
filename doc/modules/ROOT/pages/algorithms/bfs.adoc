[[algorithms-bfs-intro]]
== Introduction

The Breadth First Search algorithm is a graph traversal algorithm that given a start node visits nodes in order of increasing distance, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search.
A related algorithm is the Depth First Search algorithm, xref:algorithms/dfs.adoc[Depth First Search].
This algorithm is useful for searching when the likelihood of finding the node searched for decreases with distance.
There are multiple termination conditions supported for the traversal, based on either reaching one of several target nodes, reaching a maximum depth, exhausting a given budget of traversed relationship cost, or just traversing the whole graph.
The output of the procedure contains information about which nodes were visited and in what order.

== Examples

Consider the graph projected by the following Cypher statement:

[source, cypher, role=noplay setup-query]
----
CREATE
       (nA:Node {name: 'A'}),
       (nB:Node {name: 'B'}),
       (nC:Node {name: 'C'}),
       (nD:Node {name: 'D'}),
       (nE:Node {name: 'E'}),

       (nA)-[:REL]->(nB),
       (nA)-[:REL]->(nC),
       (nB)-[:REL]->(nE),
       (nC)-[:REL]->(nD)
----

.The following statement will project the graph and store it in the graph catalog.
[source, cypher, role=noplay graph-project-query]
----
CALL gds.graph.project('myGraph', 'Node', 'REL')
----

In the following examples we will demonstrate using the Breadth First Search algorithm on this graph.


=== Memory Estimation

:mode: stream
include::partial$/algorithms/shared/examples-estimate-intro.adoc[]

[role=query-example]
--
.The following will estimate the memory requirements for running the algorithm in stream mode:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
MATCH (source:Node {name: 'A'})
CALL gds.bfs.stream.estimate('myGraph', {
    sourceNode: source
})
YIELD nodeCount, relationshipCount, bytesMin, bytesMax, requiredMemory
RETURN nodeCount, relationshipCount, bytesMin, bytesMax, requiredMemory
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| nodeCount | relationshipCount | bytesMin | bytesMax | requiredMemory
| 5         | 4                 | 536      | 536      | "536 Bytes"
|===

=== Stream

:!stream-details:
include::partial$/algorithms/shared/examples-stream-intro.adoc[]

[role=query-example, no-result=true]
--
.The following will run the algorithm and stream results:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
MATCH (source:Node{name:'A'})
CALL gds.bfs.stream('myGraph', {
  sourceNode: source
})
YIELD path
RETURN path
----
--

If we do not specify any of the options for early termination, the algorithm will traverse the entire graph.
In the image below we can see the traversal order of the nodes, marked by relationship type `NEXT`:

[role=query-example, no-result=true]
--
.Running the Breadth First Search algorithm with target nodes:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
MATCH (a:Node{name:'A'}), (d:Node{name:'D'}), (e:Node{name:'E'})
WITH id(a) AS source, [id(d), id(e)] AS targetNodes
CALL gds.bfs.stream('myGraph', {
  sourceNode: source,
  targetNodes: targetNodes
})
YIELD path
RETURN path
----
--

In the image below we can see the traversal order of the nodes, marked by relationship type `NEXT`.
It is notable that the `D` node is not present in the picture, this is because the algorithm reached the target node `E` first and terminated the execution, leaving `D` unvisited.

[role=query-example, no-result=true]
--
.Running the Breadth First Search algorithm with maxDepth:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
MATCH (source:Node{name:'A'})
CALL gds.bfs.stream('myGraph', {
  sourceNode: source,
  maxDepth: 1
})
YIELD path
RETURN path
----
--

In the image below we can see the traversal order of the nodes, marked by relationship type `NEXT`.
Nodes `D` and `E` were not visited since they are at distance 2 from node `A`.

image::bfs-max-depth-stream-path.svg[Visualization of Breadth First Search stream with max depth ,align="center"]


=== Mutate

The `mutate` execution mode updates the named graph with new relationships.
The path returned from the Breadth First Search algorithm is a line graph, where the nodes appear in the order they were visited by the algorithm.
The relationship type has to be configured using the `mutateRelationshipType` option.

The `mutate` mode is especially useful when multiple algorithms are used in conjunction.

For more details on the `mutate` mode in general, see xref:common-usage/running-algos.adoc#running-algos-mutate[Mutate].

Breadth First Search `mutate` supports the same early termination conditions as the `stream` mode.

[role=query-example]
--
.The following will run the algorithm in `mutate` mode:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
MATCH (source:Node{name:'A'})
CALL gds.bfs.mutate('myGraph', {
  sourceNode: source,
  mutateRelationshipType: 'BFS'
})
YIELD relationshipsWritten
RETURN relationshipsWritten
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| relationshipsWritten
| 4
|===
--

After executing the above query, the in-memory graph will be updated with new relationships of type `BFS`.

[NOTE]
====
The relationships produced are always directed, even if the input graph is undirected.
