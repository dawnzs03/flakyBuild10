[[alpha-algorithms-celf-intro]]
== Introduction
The  influence maximization problem asks for a set of `k` nodes that maximize the expected spread of influence in the network.
The set of these initial `k` is called the `seed set`.

The Neo4j GDS Library supports approximate computation of the best seed set under the Independent Cascade propagation model.
In this propagation model, initially we assume that the nodes in the seed set become influenced and the process works as follows.
An influenced node influences each of its neighbors with probability `p`.
The spread is then the number of nodes that become influenced.

The Neo4j GDS Library supports the CELF algorithm, introduced in 2007 by Leskovec et al. in https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jure/pubs/detect-kdd07.pdf[Cost-effective Outbreak Detection in Networks] to compute a seed set with a large expected spread.

The CELF algorithm is based on the https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/kdd03-inf.pdf[Greedy] algorithm for the problem.
It works iteratively in `k` steps to create the returned seed set `S`,
where at each step the node yielding the maximum expected spread gain is added to `S`.

The expected spread gain of a node `u` not in `S` is estimated by running `mc` different Monte Carlo simulations of the propagation process and counting for each simulation the number of nodes that would become influenced if `u` were to be added in `S`.

The CELF algorithm extends on Greedy by introducing a _lazy forwarding_ mechanism, which
prunes a lot of nodes from being examined, thereby massively reducing the number of conducted simulations.
This makes CELF much faster than Greedy on large networks.

CALL gds.influenceMaximization.celf.write.estimate('myGraph', {
  writeProperty: 'spread',
  seedSetSize: 3
})

=== Stats

:stats-syntax: alpha-algorithms-celf-syntax
include::partial$/algorithms/shared/examples-stats-intro.adoc[]

[role=query-example]
--
.The following will run the algorithm in stats mode:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.influenceMaximization.celf.stats('myGraph', {seedSetSize: 3})
YIELD totalSpread
----

.Results
[opts="header"]

Using `stats` mode is useful to inspect how different configuration options affect the `totalSpread` and choose ones that produce optimal spread.

[[alpha-algorithms-celf-examples-stream]]
=== Stream

In the `stream` execution mode, the algorithm returns the {result} for nodes that are part of the seed set.
This allows us to inspect the results directly or post-process them in Cypher without any side effects.

For more details on the `stream` mode in general, see xref:common-usage/running-algos.adoc#running-algos-stream[Stream].

[role=query-example]
--
.The following will run the algorithm, and stream results:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.influenceMaximization.celf.stream('myGraph', {seedSetSize: 3})
YIELD nodeId, spread
RETURN gds.util.asNode(nodeId).name AS name, spread
ORDER BY spread DESC, name ASC
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| name      | spread
| "Alice"   | 1.6
| "Ceri"    | 1.08
| "Michael" | 1.08
|===
--

Note that in `stream` mode the result is only the seed set computed by the algorithm.
The other nodes are not considered influential and are not included in the result.


[[alpha-algorithms-celf-examples-mutate]]
=== Mutate

include::partial$/algorithms/shared/examples-mutate-intro.adoc[]

----
CALL gds.influenceMaximization.celf.mutate('myGraph', {
  mutateProperty: 'celfSpread',
  seedSetSize: 3
})
YIELD nodePropertiesWritten
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| nodePropertiesWritten
| 10
|===
--

[role=query-example, group=celfMutate]
--
.Stream the mutated node properties:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.graph.nodeProperty.stream('myGraph', 'celfSpread')
YIELD nodeId, propertyValue
RETURN gds.util.asNode(nodeId).name as name, propertyValue AS spread
ORDER BY spread DESC, name ASC
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| name        | spread
| "Alice"     | 1.6
| "Ceri"      | 1.08
| "Michael"   | 1.08
| "Amir"      | 0
| "Ethan"     | 0
| "Jack"      | 0
| "Jimmy"     | 0
| "Lara"      | 0
| "Mohammed"  | 0
| "Willie"    | 0

Note that in `mutate` all nodes in the in-memory graph get the `spread` property.
The nodes that are not considered influential by the algorithm receive value of zero.

Note that in `write` all nodes in Neo4j graph projected get the `spread` property.
The nodes that are not considered influential by the algorithm receive value of zero.
