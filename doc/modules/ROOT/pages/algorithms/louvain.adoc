[[algorithms-louvain-intro]]
== Introduction
The Louvain method is an algorithm to detect communities in large networks.
It maximizes a modularity score for each community, where the modularity quantifies the quality of an assignment of nodes to communities.
This means evaluating how much more densely connected the nodes within a community are, compared to how connected they would be in a random network.

The Louvain algorithm is a hierarchical clustering algorithm, that recursively merges communities into a single node and executes the modularity clustering on the condensed graphs.

For more information on this algorithm, see:

== Examples

:algorithm-name: Louvain community detection
:graph-description: social network
:image-file: two-user-communities.svg
include::partial$/algorithms/shared/examples-intro.adoc[]

.The following Cypher statement will create the example graph in the Neo4j database:
[source, cypher, role=noplay setup-query]
----
CREATE
  (nAlice:User {name: 'Alice', seed: 42}),
  (nBridget:User {name: 'Bridget', seed: 42}),
  (nCharles:User {name: 'Charles', seed: 42}),
  (nDoug:User {name: 'Doug'}),
  (nMark:User {name: 'Mark'}),
  (nMichael:User {name: 'Michael'}),

  (nAlice)-[:LINK {weight: 1}]->(nBridget),
  (nAlice)-[:LINK {weight: 1}]->(nCharles),
  (nCharles)-[:LINK {weight: 1}]->(nBridget),

  (nAlice)-[:LINK {weight: 5}]->(nDoug),

  (nMark)-[:LINK {weight: 1}]->(nDoug),
  (nMark)-[:LINK {weight: 1}]->(nMichael),
  (nMichael)-[:LINK {weight: 1}]->(nMark);
----

This graph has two clusters of _Users_, that are closely connected.
Between those clusters there is one single edge.
The relationships that connect the nodes in each component have a property `weight` which determines the strength of the relationship.

We can now project the graph and store it in the graph catalog.
We load the `LINK` relationships with orientation set to `UNDIRECTED` as this works best with the Louvain algorithm.

include::partial$/algorithms/shared/examples-named-native-note.adoc[]

.The following statement will project the graph and store it in the graph catalog.
[source, cypher, role=noplay graph-project-query]
----
CALL gds.graph.project(
    'myGraph',
    'User',
    {
        LINK: {
            orientation: 'UNDIRECTED'
        }
    },
    {
        nodeProperties: 'seed',
        relationshipProperties: 'weight'
    }
)

In the following examples we will demonstrate using the Louvain algorithm on this graph.

[[algorithms-louvain-examples-stream]]
=== Stream

include::partial$/algorithms/shared/examples-stream-intro.adoc[]

[role=query-example]
--
.The following will run the algorithm and stream results:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.louvain.stream('myGraph')
YIELD nodeId, communityId, intermediateCommunityIds
RETURN gds.util.asNode(nodeId).name AS name, communityId
ORDER BY name ASC

| "Bridget" | 2

| "Mark"    | 5
| "Michael" | 5
|===
--

We use default values for the procedure configuration parameter.
Levels and `innerIterations` are set to 10 and the tolerance value is 0.0001.


[[algorithms-louvain-examples-stats]]
=== Stats

:stats-syntax: algorithms-louvain-syntax
include::partial$/algorithms/shared/examples-stats-intro.adoc[]

[role=query-example]
--
.The following will run the algorithm and returns the result in form of statistical and measurement values
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.louvain.stats('myGraph')

[[algorithms-louvain-examples-mutate]]
=== Mutate

include::partial$/algorithms/shared/examples-mutate-intro.adoc[]

[role=query-example]
--
.The following will run the algorithm and store the results in `myGraph`:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.louvain.mutate('myGraph', { mutateProperty: 'communityId' })
YIELD communityCount, modularity, modularities
----

.Results

|1 row
|===
--

In `mutate` mode, only a single row is returned by the procedure.
The result contains meta information, like the number of identified communities and the modularity values.
In contrast to the `write` mode the result is written to the GDS in-memory graph instead of the Neo4j database.


[[algorithms-louvain-examples-write]]
=== Write

include::partial$/algorithms/shared/examples-write-intro.adoc[]

[role=query-example]
--
.The following run the algorithm, and write back results:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.louvain.write('myGraph', { writeProperty: 'community' })
YIELD communityCount, modularity, modularities
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| communityCount | modularity         | modularities
| 2              | 0.3571428571428571 | [0.3571428571428571]
|1 row
|===
--

When writing back the results, only a single row is returned by the procedure.
The result contains meta information, like the number of identified communities and the modularity values.


[[algorithms-louvain-examples-stream-weighted]]
=== Weighted

The Louvain algorithm can also run on weighted graphs, taking the given relationship weights into concern when calculating the modularity.

[role=query-example]
--
.The following will run the algorithm on a weighted graph and stream results:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.louvain.stream('myGraph', { relationshipWeightProperty: 'weight' })
YIELD nodeId, communityId, intermediateCommunityIds
RETURN gds.util.asNode(nodeId).name AS name, communityId
ORDER BY name ASC
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| name      | communityId
| "Alice"   | 3
| "Bridget" | 2
| "Charles" | 2
| "Doug"    | 3
| "Mark"    | 5
| "Michael" | 5
|===
--

Using the weighted relationships, we see that `Alice` and `Doug` have formed their own community, as their link is much stronger than all the others.


[[algorithms-louvain-examples-stream-seeded]]
=== Seeded

The Louvain algorithm can be run incrementally, by providing a seed property.
With the seed property an initial community mapping can be supplied for a subset of the loaded nodes.
The algorithm will try to keep the seeded community IDs.

[role=query-example]
--
.The following will run the algorithm and stream results:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.louvain.stream('myGraph', { seedProperty: 'seed' })
YIELD nodeId, communityId, intermediateCommunityIds
RETURN gds.util.asNode(nodeId).name AS name, communityId
ORDER BY name ASC
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| name      | communityId
| "Alice"   | 42
| "Bridget" | 42
| "Charles" | 42
| "Doug"    | 47
| "Mark"    | 47
| "Michael" | 47
|===
--

Using the seeded graph, we see that the community around `Alice` keeps its initial community ID of `42`.
The other community is assigned a new community ID, which is guaranteed to be larger than the largest seeded community ID.
Note that the `consecutiveIds` configuration option cannot be used in combination with seeding in order to retain the seeding values.


=== Using intermediate communities

As described before, Louvain is a hierarchical clustering algorithm.
That means that after every clustering step all nodes that belong to the same cluster are reduced to a single node.
Relationships between nodes of the same cluster become self-relationships, relationships to nodes of other clusters connect to the clusters representative.
This condensed graph is then used to run the next level of clustering.
The process is repeated until the clusters are stable.

In order to demonstrate this iterative behavior, we need to construct a more complex graph.
