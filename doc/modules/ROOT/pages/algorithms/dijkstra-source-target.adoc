[[algorithms-dijkstra-source-target-intro]]
== Introduction

The Dijkstra Shortest Path algorithm computes the shortest path between nodes.
The algorithm supports weighted graphs with positive relationship weights.
The Dijkstra Source-Target algorithm computes the shortest path between a source and a target node.
To compute all paths from a source node to all reachable nodes, xref:algorithms/dijkstra-single-source.adoc[Dijkstra Single-Source] can be used.

The GDS implementation is based on the https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/doc_view/pid/6855bd86e3d6d4278fac61a4924417fd3e0f9643[original description] and uses a binary heap as priority queue.
The implementation is also used for the xref:algorithms/astar.adoc[A*] and xref:algorithms/yens.adoc[Yen's] algorithms.
The algorithm implementation is executed using a single thread.
Altering the concurrency configuration has no effect.

.The following Cypher statement will create the example graph in the Neo4j database:
[source, cypher, role=noplay setup-query]
----
CREATE (a:Location {name: 'A'}),
       (b:Location {name: 'B'}),
       (c:Location {name: 'C'}),
       (d:Location {name: 'D'}),
       (e:Location {name: 'E'}),
       (f:Location {name: 'F'}),
       (a)-[:ROAD {cost: 50}]->(b),
       (a)-[:ROAD {cost: 50}]->(c),
       (a)-[:ROAD {cost: 100}]->(d),
       (b)-[:ROAD {cost: 40}]->(d),
       (c)-[:ROAD {cost: 40}]->(d),
       (c)-[:ROAD {cost: 80}]->(e),
       (d)-[:ROAD {cost: 30}]->(e),
       (d)-[:ROAD {cost: 80}]->(f),
       (e)-[:ROAD {cost: 40}]->(f);
----

This graph builds a transportation network with roads between locations.
Like in the real world, the roads in the graph have different lengths.
These lengths are represented by the `cost` relationship property.

include::partial$/algorithms/shared/examples-named-native-note.adoc[]

.The following statement will project a graph using a native projection and store it in the graph catalog under the name 'myGraph'.
[source, cypher, role=noplay graph-project-query]
----
CALL gds.graph.project(
    'myGraph',
    'Location',
    'ROAD',
    {
        relationshipProperties: 'cost'
    }
)
----

In the following example we will demonstrate the use of the {algorithm} Shortest Path algorithm using this graph.

The result shows the total cost of the shortest path between node `A` and node `F`.
It also shows an ordered list of node ids that were traversed to find the shortest path as well as the accumulated costs of the visited nodes.
This can be verified in the xref:algorithms/dijkstra-source-target.adoc#algorithms-dijkstra-source-target-examples[example graph].
Cypher Path objects can be returned by the `path` return field.
The Path objects contain the node objects and virtual relationships which have a `cost` property.

----
MATCH (source:Location {name: 'A'}), (target:Location {name: 'F'})
CALL gds.shortestPath.dijkstra.mutate('myGraph', {
    sourceNode: source,
    targetNode: target,
    relationshipWeightProperty: 'cost',
    mutateRelationshipType: 'PATH'
})

After executing the above query, the projected graph will be updated with a new relationship of type `PATH`.
The new relationship will store a single property `totalCost`.

[NOTE]
====
The relationship produced is always directed, even if the input graph is undirected.

.The following will run the algorithm in `write` mode:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
MATCH (source:Location {name: 'A'}), (target:Location {name: 'F'})
CALL gds.shortestPath.dijkstra.write('myGraph', {
    sourceNode: source,

|===
--

The above query will write a single relationship of type `PATH` back to Neo4j.
The relationship stores three properties describing the path: `totalCost`, `nodeIds` and `costs`.

[NOTE]
====
The relationship written is always directed, even if the input graph is undirected.
