[[algorithms-article-rank-introduction]]
== Introduction

ArticleRank is a variant of the xref:algorithms/page-rank.adoc[Page Rank algorithm], which measures the *transitive* influence of nodes.

Page Rank follows the assumption that relationships originating from low-degree nodes have a higher influence than relationships from high-degree nodes.
Article Rank lowers the influence of low-degree nodes by lowering the scores being sent to their neighbors in each iteration.

The Article Rank of a node _v_ at iteration _i_ is defined as:

image::equations/articleRank.svg[]

where,

* _N~in~(v)_ denotes incoming neighbors and _N~out~(v)_ denotes outgoing neighbors of node _v_.
* _d_ is a damping factor in _[0, 1]_.
* _[overline]#N#~out~_ is the average out-degree

For more information, see https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/00012530911005544[ArticleRank: a PageRank‐based alternative to numbers of citations for analysing citation networks^].

[[algorithms-article-rank-considerations]]
== Considerations

There are some things to be aware of when using the Article Rank algorithm:

* If there are no relationships from within a group of pages to outside the group, then the group is considered a spider trap.
* Rank sink can occur when a network of pages is forming an infinite cycle.
* Dead-ends occur when pages have no outgoing relationship.

Changing the damping factor can help with all the considerations above.
It can be interpreted as a probability of a web surfer to sometimes jump to a random page and therefore not getting stuck in sinks.

The above query is running the algorithm in `stream` mode as `unweighted`.
Below, one can find an example for xref:algorithms/article-rank.adoc#algorithms-article-rank-examples-weighted[weighted graphs].


[[algorithms-article-rank-examples-stats]]
=== Stats

:stats-details: For example Eigenvector stats returns centrality histogram which can be used to monitor the distribution of centrality scores across all computed nodes.

[[algorithms-article-rank-examples-mutate]]
=== Mutate

include::partial$/algorithms/shared/examples-mutate-intro.adoc[]

[role=query-example]
--
.The following will run the algorithm in `mutate` mode:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.articleRank.mutate('myGraph', {
  mutateProperty: 'centrality'

[[algorithms-article-rank-examples-weighted]]
=== Weighted

By default, the algorithm considers the relationships of the graph to be unweighted.
To change this behaviour, we can use the `relationshipWeightProperty` configuration parameter.
If the parameter is set, the associated property value is used as relationship weight.
In the `weighted` case, the previous score of a node sent to its neighbors is multiplied by the normalized relationship weight.
Note, that negative relationship weights are ignored during the computation.

In the following example, we use the `weight` property of the input graph as relationship weight property.

[role=query-example]
--
.The following will run the algorithm in `stream` mode using relationship weights:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.articleRank.stream('myGraph', {
  relationshipWeightProperty: 'weight'
})
YIELD nodeId, score
RETURN gds.util.asNode(nodeId).name AS name, score
ORDER BY score DESC, name ASC
----

.Results
[opts="header",cols="1,1"]
|===
| name      | score
| "Home"    | 0.5160810726222141
| "Product" | 0.24570958074084706
| "About"   | 0.1819031935802824
| "Links"   | 0.1819031935802824
| "Site A"  | 0.15281123078335393
| "Site B"  | 0.15281123078335393
| "Site C"  | 0.15281123078335393
| "Site D"  | 0.15281123078335393
|===
--

As in the unweighted example, the "Home" node has the highest score.
In contrast, the "Product" now has the second highest instead of the fourth highest score.

NOTE: We are using `stream` mode to illustrate running the algorithm as `weighted`, however, all the algorithm modes support the `relationshipWeightProperty` configuration parameter.


[[algorithms-article-rank-examples-tolerance]]
=== Tolerance

The `tolerance` configuration parameter denotes the minimum change in scores between iterations.
If all scores change less than the configured tolerance, the iteration is aborted and considered converged.
Note, that setting a higher tolerance leads to earlier convergence, but also to less accurate centrality scores.

[role=query-example]
--
.The following will run the algorithm in `stream` mode using a high `tolerance` value:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.articleRank.stream('myGraph', {
  tolerance: 0.1
})
YIELD nodeId, score
RETURN gds.util.asNode(nodeId).name AS name, score
ORDER BY score DESC, name ASC
----

.Results
[opts="header",cols="1,1"]
|===
| name      | score
| "Home"    | 0.4470707070707072
| "About"   | 0.23000212652844235
| "Links"   | 0.23000212652844235
| "Product" | 0.23000212652844235
| "Site A"  | 0.16888888888888892
| "Site B"  | 0.16888888888888892
| "Site C"  | 0.16888888888888892
| "Site D"  | 0.16888888888888892
|===
--

We are using `tolerance: 0.1`, which leads to slightly different results compared to the xref:algorithms/article-rank.adoc#algorithms-article-rank-examples-stream[stream example].
However, the computation converges after four iterations, and we can already observe a trend in the resulting scores.


[[algorithms-article-rank-examples-personalised]]
=== Personalised Article Rank

Personalized Article Rank is a variation of Article Rank which is biased towards a set of `sourceNodes`.
By default, the power iteration starts with the same value for all nodes: `1 / |V|`.
For a given set of source nodes `S`, the initial value of each source node is set to `1 / |S|` and to `0` for all remaining nodes.

The following examples show how to run Eigenvector centrality centered around 'Site A' and 'Site B'.

[role=query-example]
--
.The following will run the algorithm and stream results:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
MATCH (siteA:Page {name: 'Site A'}), (siteB:Page {name: 'Site B'})
CALL gds.articleRank.stream('myGraph', {
  maxIterations: 20,
  sourceNodes: [siteA, siteB]
})
YIELD nodeId, score
RETURN gds.util.asNode(nodeId).name AS name, score
ORDER BY score DESC, name ASC
----

.Results
[opts="header",cols="1,1"]
|===
| name      | score
| "Site A"  | 0.15249052775314756
| "Site B"  | 0.15249052775314756
| "Home"    | 0.1105231342997017
| "About"   | 0.019777824032578193
| "Links"   | 0.019777824032578193
| "Product" | 0.019777824032578193
| "Site C"  | 0.002490527753147571
| "Site D"  | 0.002490527753147571
|===
--

Comparing these results to the ones from the xref:algorithms/article-rank.adoc#algorithms-article-rank-examples-stream[stream example] (which is not using `sourceNodes` configuration parameter) shows the 'Site A' and `Site B` nodes we used in the `sourceNodes` list now score second and third instead of fourth and fifth.


[[algorithms-article-rank-examples-scaler]]
=== Scaling centrality scores

To normalize the final scores as part of the algorithm execution, one can use the `scaler` configuration parameter.
A description of all available scalers can be found in the documentation for the xref:machine-learning/pre-processing/scale-properties.adoc[`scaleProperties`] procedure.

[role=query-example]
--
.The following will run the algorithm in `stream` mode and returns normalized results:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.articleRank.stream('myGraph', {
  scaler: "StdScore"
})
YIELD nodeId, score
RETURN gds.util.asNode(nodeId).name AS name, score
ORDER BY score DESC, name ASC
----

.Results
[opts="header",cols="1,1"]
|===
| name      | score
| "Home"    | 2.550761988515413
| "About"   | -0.036593974039468
| "Links"   | -0.036593974039468
| "Product" | -0.036593974039468
| "Site A"  | -0.610245016599252
| "Site B"  | -0.610245016599252
| "Site C"  | -0.610245016599252
| "Site D"  | -0.610245016599252

|===
--

Comparing the results with the xref:algorithms/article-rank.adoc#algorithms-article-rank-examples-stream[stream example], we can see that the relative order of scores is the same.
