[[algorithms-yens-intro]]
== Introduction

Yen's Shortest Path algorithm computes a number of shortest paths between two nodes.
The algorithm is often referred to as Yen's k-Shortest Path algorithm, where k is the number of shortest paths to compute.
The algorithm supports weighted graphs with positive relationship weights.
It also respects parallel relationships between the same two nodes when computing multiple shortest paths.

For `k = 1`, the algorithm behaves exactly like xref:algorithms/dijkstra-source-target.adoc[Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm] and returns the shortest path.
For `k = 2`, the algorithm returns the shortest path and the second shortest path between the same source and target node.
Generally, for `k = n`, the algorithm computes at most `n` paths which are discovered in the order of their total cost.

The GDS implementation is based on the https://www.ams.org/journals/qam/1970-27-04/S0033-569X-1970-0253822-7/[original description].
For the actual path computation, Yen's algorithm uses xref:algorithms/dijkstra-source-target.adoc[Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm].
The algorithm makes sure that an already discovered shortest path will not be traversed again.

The algorithm implementation is parallelized, but limited by the number of nodes in source-target paths.
If these paths are expected to have small length (i.e., a few new nodes) setting a high value for concurrency is discouraged as some of the cores might be left unitilized.

.The following Cypher statement will create the example graph in the Neo4j database:
[source, cypher, role=noplay setup-query]
----
CREATE (a:Location {name: 'A'}),
       (b:Location {name: 'B'}),
       (c:Location {name: 'C'}),
       (d:Location {name: 'D'}),
       (e:Location {name: 'E'}),
       (f:Location {name: 'F'}),
       (a)-[:ROAD {cost: 50}]->(b),
       (a)-[:ROAD {cost: 50}]->(c),
       (a)-[:ROAD {cost: 100}]->(d),
       (b)-[:ROAD {cost: 40}]->(d),
       (c)-[:ROAD {cost: 40}]->(d),
       (c)-[:ROAD {cost: 80}]->(e),
       (d)-[:ROAD {cost: 30}]->(e),
       (d)-[:ROAD {cost: 80}]->(f),
       (e)-[:ROAD {cost: 40}]->(f);

This graph builds a transportation network with roads between locations.
Like in the real world, the roads in the graph have different lengths.
These lengths are represented by the `cost` relationship property.

.The following statement will project a graph using a native projection and store it in the graph catalog under the name 'myGraph'.

    'Location',
    'ROAD',
    {
        relationshipProperties: 'cost'

In the following example we will demonstrate the use of the {algorithm} Shortest Path algorithm using this graph.

The result shows the three shortest paths between node `A` and node `F`.
The first two paths have the same total cost, however the first one traversed from `A` to `D` via the `B` node, while the second traversed via the `C` node.
The third path has a higher total cost as it goes directly from `D` to `F` using the relationship with a cost of `80`, whereas the detour via `E` for the first two paths costs `70`.
This can be verified in the xref:algorithms/yens.adoc#algorithms-yens-examples[example graph].
Cypher Path objects can be returned by the `path` return field.
The Path objects contain the node objects and virtual relationships which have a `cost` property.
