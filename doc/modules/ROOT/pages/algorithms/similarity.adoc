:description: This chapter provides explanations and examples for the similarity algorithms in the Neo4j Graph Data Science library.


Similarity algorithms compute the similarity of pairs of nodes based on their neighborhoods or their properties.
Several similarity metrics can be used to compute a similarity score.
The Neo4j GDS library includes the following similarity algorithms:

* xref:algorithms/node-similarity.adoc[Node Similarity]
** xref:algorithms/filtered-node-similarity.adoc[Filtered Node Similarity]
* xref:algorithms/knn.adoc[K-Nearest Neighbors]
** xref:algorithms/filtered-knn.adoc[Filtered K-Nearest Neighbors]

As well as a collection of different xref:algorithms/similarity-functions.adoc[similarity functions] for calculating similarity between arrays of numbers
