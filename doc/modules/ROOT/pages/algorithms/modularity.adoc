== Introduction

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modularity_(networks)[Modularity] is a metric that allows you to evaluate the quality of a community detection.
Relationships of nodes in a community `C` connect to nodes either within `C` or outside `C`.
Graphs with high modularity have dense connections between the nodes within communities but sparse connections between nodes in different communities.

== Examples

:algorithm-name: Modularity
:graph-description: social network
:image-file: two-user-communities.svg
include::partial$/algorithms/shared/examples-intro.adoc[]

.The following Cypher statement will create the example graph in the Neo4j database:
[source, cypher, role=noplay setup-query]
----
CREATE
  (nAlice:User {name: 'Alice', community: 3}),
  (nBridget:User {name: 'Bridget', community: 2}),
  (nCharles:User {name: 'Charles', community: 2}),
  (nDoug:User {name: 'Doug', community: 3}),
  (nMark:User {name: 'Mark', community: 5}),
  (nMichael:User {name: 'Michael', community: 5}),

  (nAlice)-[:LINK {weight: 1}]->(nBridget),
  (nAlice)-[:LINK {weight: 1}]->(nCharles),
  (nCharles)-[:LINK {weight: 1}]->(nBridget),

  (nAlice)-[:LINK {weight: 5}]->(nDoug),

  (nMark)-[:LINK {weight: 1}]->(nDoug),
  (nMark)-[:LINK {weight: 1}]->(nMichael),
  (nMichael)-[:LINK {weight: 1}]->(nMark);
----

This graph has three pre-computed communities of _Users_, that are closely connected.
For more details on the available community detection algorithms, please refer to xref:algorithms/community.adoc[Community algorithms] section of the documentation.
The communities are indicated by the `community` node property on each node.
The relationships that connect the nodes in each component have a property `weight` which determines the strength of the relationship.

We can now project the graph and store it in the graph catalog.
We load the `LINK` relationships with orientation set to `UNDIRECTED`.

include::partial$/algorithms/shared/examples-named-native-note.adoc[]

.The following statement will project the graph and store it in the graph catalog.
[source, cypher, role=noplay graph-project-query]
----
CALL gds.graph.project(
    'myGraph',
    'User',
    {
        LINK: {
            orientation: 'UNDIRECTED'
        }
    },
    {
        nodeProperties: 'community',
        relationshipProperties: 'weight'
    }
)

:mode: stats
include::partial$/algorithms/shared/examples-estimate-intro.adoc[]

[role=query-example]

.The following will estimate the memory requirements for running the algorithm in stats mode:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.modularity.stats.estimate('myGraph', {
     communityProperty: 'community',
     relationshipWeightProperty: 'weight'
})
YIELD nodeCount, relationshipCount, bytesMin, bytesMax, requiredMemory
----

.Results

|===
| nodeCount | relationshipCount | bytesMin | bytesMax | requiredMemory
| 6       | 14               | 848     | 848      | "848 Bytes"

=== Stream

Since we have community information on each node, we can evaluate how good it is under the modularity metric.
Note that we in this case we use the feature of relationships being weighted by a relationship property.

The Modularity stream procedure returns the modularity for each community.
This allows us to inspect the results directly or post-process them in Cypher without any side effects.

For more details on the stream mode in general, see xref:common-usage/running-algos.adoc#running-algos-stream[Stream].

[role=query-example]
--
.The following will run the Modularity algorithm in `stream` mode:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.modularity.stream('myGraph', {
     communityProperty: 'community',
     relationshipWeightProperty: 'weight'
})
YIELD communityId, modularity
RETURN communityId, modularity
ORDER BY communityId ASC
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| communityId | modularity
| 2           | 0.057851239669421
| 3           | 0.105371900826446
| 5           | 0.130165289256198

We can see that the community of the weighted graph with the highest modularity is community 5.
This means that 5 is the community that is most "well-knit" in the sense that most of its relationship weights are internal to the community.
