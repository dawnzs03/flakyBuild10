== Introduction

Given a source node and a list of target nodes, a directed spanning tree in which there exists a path from the source node to each of the target nodes is called a Directed Steiner Tree.

The Minimum Directed Steiner Tree problem asks for the steiner tree that minimizes the sum of all relationship weights in tree.

The Minimum Directed Steiner Tree problem is known to be NP-Complete and no efficient exact algorithms have been proposed in the literature.
The Neo4j GDS Library offers an efficient implementation of a well-known https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-45643-0_1[heuristic] for Steiner Tree related problems.

The implemented algorithm works on a number of steps.
At each step, the shortest path from the source to one of the undiscovered targets is found and added to the result.
Following that, the weights in the relationships in this path are reduced to zero, and the algorithm continues similarly by finding the next closest unvisited target node.

With a careful implementation, the above heuristic can run efficiently even for graphs of large size.
In addition, the parallel shortest path algorithm of xref:algorithms/delta-single-source.adoc[Delta-Stepping] is used to further speed-up computations.


== Considerations

As the Minimum Directed Steiner Tree algorithm relies on shortest-paths, it will not work for graphs with negative relationship weights.

The Minimum Directed Steiner Tree problem is a variant of the more general Minimum Steiner Tree problem defined for undirected graphs.
The Minimum Steiner Tree problem accepts as input only a set of target nodes.
The aim is then to find a spanning tree of minimum weight connecting these target nodes.

It is possible to use the GDS implementation to find a solution for Minimum Steiner Tree problem by arbitrarily selecting one of the target nodes to fill the role of the source node.

The algorithm first finds the shortest path from A to D.
Then, even though the relationship weight from A to E is less than the sum of weighted path A,B,C,E, the algorithm realizes that the relationships between A and B as well as B and C are already included in the solution and therefore reaching E via C is a better alternative.
Finally, the algorithm adds the relationship between A and F in the solution and terminates.

[[algorithms-steiner-tree-examples-rerouting]]
=== Rerouting examples


It is also possible to try and augment the solution discovered by the heuristic via a post-processing rerouting phase.
This option can be enabled by setting `applyRerouting: true` in the configuration.

The algorithm supports two forms of rerouting: _simple_ and _extended_.
Extended is more involved than simple and can get better quality improvements, but it requires having an inverse index for the adjacency list.

==== Simple Rerouting

The rerouting phase re-examines the relationships in the discovered steiner tree and tries to reroute nodes (that is change their parent with another node in the tree) so as to decrease the cost.
After the rerouting phase some nodes might end up being childless, that is not part of any path between the source and a target.
Such nodes are then removed from the returned solution.

Note that there is no guarantee that enabling rerouting will always lead to an improvement in quality.

[role=query-example]
--
.The following will run the Minimum Directed Steiner Tree algorithm with rerouting in stream mode and return results for each valid node.
[source,cypher,role=noplay]
----
MATCH (a:Place{id: 'A'}), (d:Place{id: 'D'}),(e:Place{id: 'E'}),(f:Place{id: 'F'})
CALL gds.steinerTree.stream('graph', {
  sourceNode: id(a),
  targetNodes: [id(d), id(e), id(f)],
  relationshipWeightProperty: 'cost',
  applyRerouting: true
})
YIELD nodeId,parentId, weight
RETURN gds.util.asNode(nodeId).id AS node, gds.util.asNode(parentId).id AS parent, weight
ORDER BY node
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| node | parent | weight
| "A"  | "A"    | 0
| "B"  | "A"    | 1
| "C"  | "B"    | 1
| "D"  | "F"    | 3
| "E"  | "C"    | 6
| "F"  | "A"    | 10
|===
--

As can be seen, thanks to the rerouting step, D's parent has been replaced with F and the overall weight of the steiner tree is reduced by 2.

==== Extended Rerouting

We now demonstrate the usage of extended rerouting.
For that, first we need to project the graph once more, this time creating an inverse index.
[role=query-example, no-result=true, group=extended]
--
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.graph.project(
  'inverseGraph',
  'Place',
  {
    LINK: {
      properties: 'cost', indexInverse: true
    }
  }
)
----
--
We know repeat the algorithm; this time with the extended rerouting heuristic.

[role=query-example, group=extended]
--
[source,cypher,role=noplay]
----
MATCH (a:Place{id: 'A'}), (d:Place{id: 'D'}),(e:Place{id: 'E'}),(f:Place{id: 'F'})
CALL gds.steinerTree.stream('inverseGraph', {
  sourceNode: id(a),
  targetNodes: [id(d), id(e), id(f)],
  relationshipWeightProperty: 'cost',
  applyRerouting: true
})
YIELD nodeId,parentId, weight
RETURN gds.util.asNode(nodeId).id AS node, gds.util.asNode(parentId).id AS parent, weight
ORDER BY node
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| node | parent | weight
| "A"  | "A"    | 0
| "D"  | "F"    | 3
| "E"  | "A"    | 7
| "F"  | "A"    | 10
|===
--

As you can see, thanks to the extended rerouting, we can further reduce the cost  and return the optimal steiner tree having a weight of 20.
[NOTE]
====
Unlike the main algorithm, the rerouting phase runs sequentially and is not affected by the concurrency parameter.
