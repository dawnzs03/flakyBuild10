Random Walk is an algorithm that provides random paths in a graph.

A random walk simulates a traversal of the graph in which the traversed relationships are chosen at random.
In a classic random walk, each relationship has the same, possibly weighted, probability of being picked.
This probability is not influenced by the previously visited nodes.
The random walk implementation of the Neo4j Graph Data Science library supports the concept of second order random walks.
This method tries to model the transition probability based on the currently visited node `v`, the node `t` visited before the current one, and the node `x` which is the target of a candidate relationship.
Random walks are thus influenced by two parameters: the `returnFactor` and the `inOutFactor`:

* The `returnFactor` is used if `t` equals `x`, i.e., the random walk returns to the previously visited node.
* The `inOutFactor` is used if the distance from `t` to `x` is equal to 2, i.e., the walk traverses further away from the node `t`

The probabilities for traversing a relationship during a random walk can be further influenced by specifying a `relationshipWeightProperty`.
A relationship property value greater than 1 will increase the likelihood of a relationship being traversed, a property value between 0 and 1 will decrease that probability.

[NOTE]
To obtain a random walk where the transition probability is independent of the previously visited nodes both the `returnFactor` and the `inOutFactor` can be set to 1.0.

====
Running this algorithm requires sufficient memory availability.
Before running this algorithm, we recommend that you read xref:common-usage/memory-estimation.adoc[Memory Estimation].
