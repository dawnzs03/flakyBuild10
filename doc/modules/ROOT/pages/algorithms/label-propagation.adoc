[[algorithms-label-propagation-intro]]
== Introduction

The Label Propagation algorithm (LPA) is a fast algorithm for finding communities in a graph.
It detects these communities using network structure alone as its guide, and doesn't require a pre-defined objective function or prior information about the communities.

LPA works by propagating labels throughout the network and forming communities based on this process of label propagation.

The intuition behind the algorithm is that a single label can quickly become dominant in a densely connected group of nodes, but will have trouble crossing a sparsely connected region.
Labels will get trapped inside a densely connected group of nodes, and those nodes that end up with the same label when the algorithms finish can be considered part of the same community.

The algorithm works as follows:

* Every node is initialized with a unique community label (an identifier).
* These labels propagate through the network.
// TODO: Rethink the below sentence
* At every iteration of propagation, each node updates its label to the one that the maximum numbers of its neighbours belongs to.
Ties are broken arbitrarily but deterministically.
* LPA reaches convergence when each node has the majority label of its neighbours.
* LPA stops if either convergence, or the user-defined maximum number of iterations is achieved.

As labels propagate, densely connected groups of nodes quickly reach a consensus on a unique label.
At the end of the propagation only a few labels will remain - most will have disappeared.
Nodes that have the same community label at convergence are said to belong to the same community.

One interesting feature of LPA is that nodes can be assigned preliminary labels to narrow down the range of solutions generated.
This means that it can be used as semi-supervised way of finding communities where we hand-pick some initial communities.

== Examples

:algorithm-name: {algorithm}
:graph-description: social network
:image-file: label-propagation-graph.svg
include::partial$/algorithms/shared/examples-intro.adoc[]

.The following Cypher statement will create the example graph in the Neo4j database:
[source, cypher, role=noplay setup-query]
----
CREATE
  (alice:User {name: 'Alice', posts: 4, seed_label: 52}),
  (bridget:User {name: 'Bridget', posts: 13, seed_label: 21}),
  (charles:User {name: 'Charles', posts: 55, seed_label: 43}),
  (doug:User {name: 'Doug', posts: 5, seed_label: 21}),
  (mark:User {name: 'Mark', posts: 7, seed_label: 19}),
  (michael:User {name: 'Michael', posts: 15, seed_label: 52}),

  (alice)-[:FOLLOW {weight: 1}]->(bridget),
  (alice)-[:FOLLOW {weight: 10}]->(charles),
  (mark)-[:FOLLOW {weight: 1}]->(doug),
  (bridget)-[:FOLLOW {weight: 1}]->(michael),
  (doug)-[:FOLLOW {weight: 1}]->(mark),
  (michael)-[:FOLLOW {weight: 1}]->(alice),
  (alice)-[:FOLLOW {weight: 1}]->(michael),
  (bridget)-[:FOLLOW {weight: 1}]->(alice),
  (michael)-[:FOLLOW {weight: 1}]->(bridget),
  (charles)-[:FOLLOW {weight: 1}]->(doug)
----

This graph represents six users, some of whom follow each other.
Besides a `name` property, each user also has a `seed_label` property.
The `seed_label` property represents a value in the graph used to seed the node with a label.
For example, this can be a result from a previous run of the Label Propagation algorithm.
In addition, each relationship has a weight property.

include::partial$/algorithms/shared/examples-named-native-note.adoc[]

.The following statement will project a graph using a native projection and store it in the graph catalog under the name 'myGraph'.
[source, cypher, role=noplay graph-project-query]
----
CALL gds.graph.project(
    'myGraph',
    'User',
    'FOLLOW',
    {
        nodeProperties: ['posts', 'seed_label'],
        relationshipProperties: 'weight'
    }
)
----

In the following examples we will demonstrate using the Label Propagation algorithm on this graph.


[[algorithms-label-propagation-examples-memory-estimation]]
=== Memory Estimation

:mode: write
include::partial$/algorithms/shared/examples-estimate-intro.adoc[]

[role=query-example]
--
.The following will estimate the memory requirements for running the algorithm in write mode:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.labelPropagation.write.estimate('myGraph', { writeProperty: 'community' })
YIELD nodeCount, relationshipCount, bytesMin, bytesMax, requiredMemory
----

.Results

| nodeCount | relationshipCount | bytesMin  | bytesMax  | requiredMemory
| 6         | 10                | 1592      | 1592      | "1592 Bytes"

[[algorithms-label-propagation-examples-stream]]
=== Stream

:stream-details: For example, we can order the results to see the nodes that belong to the same communities displayed next to each other.
include::partial$/algorithms/shared/examples-stream-intro.adoc[]

[role=query-example]
--
.The following will run the algorithm and stream results:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.labelPropagation.stream('myGraph')
YIELD nodeId, communityId AS Community
RETURN gds.util.asNode(nodeId).name AS Name, Community
ORDER BY Community, Name
----

.Results
[opts="header",cols="1,1"]
|===
| Name    | Community
| "Alice"   | 1
| "Bridget" | 1
| "Michael" | 1
| "Charles" | 4
| "Doug"    | 4
| "Mark"    | 4
|===
--

In the above example we can see that our graph has two communities each containing three nodes.
The default behaviour of the algorithm is to run `unweighted`, e.g. without using `node` or `relationship` weights.
The `weighted` option will be demonstrated in xref:algorithms/label-propagation.adoc#algorithms-label-propagation-examples-weighted[Weighted]


[[algorithms-label-propagation-examples-stats]]
=== Stats

:stats-syntax: algorithms-label-propagation-syntax
include::partial$/algorithms/shared/examples-stats-intro.adoc[]

.The following will run the algorithm in `stats` mode:
[role=query-example]
--
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.labelPropagation.stats('myGraph')
YIELD communityCount, ranIterations, didConverge
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| communityCount | ranIterations | didConverge
| 2              | 3             | true
|===
--

As we can see from the example above the algorithm finds two communities and converges in three iterations.
Note that we ran the algorithm `unweighted`.

[[algorithms-label-propagation-examples-mutate]]
=== Mutate

include::partial$/algorithms/shared/examples-mutate-intro.adoc[]

[role=query-example]
--
.The following will run the algorithm and write back results:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.labelPropagation.mutate('myGraph', { mutateProperty: 'community' })
YIELD communityCount, ranIterations, didConverge
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| communityCount | ranIterations | didConverge
| 2              | 3             | true
|===
--

The returned result is the same as in the `stats` example.
Additionally, the graph 'myGraph' now has a node property `community` which stores the community ID for each node.
To find out how to inspect the new schema of the in-memory graph, see xref:management-ops/graph-list.adoc[Listing graphs].


[[algorithms-label-propagation-examples-write]]
=== Write

include::partial$/algorithms/shared/examples-write-intro.adoc[]

[role=query-example]
--
.The following will run the algorithm and write back results:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.labelPropagation.write('myGraph', { writeProperty: 'community' })
YIELD communityCount, ranIterations, didConverge
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| communityCount | ranIterations | didConverge
| 2              | 3             | true
|===
--

The returned result is the same as in the `stats` example.
Additionally, each of the six nodes now has a new property `community` in the Neo4j database, containing the community ID for that node.

[[algorithms-label-propagation-examples-weighted]]
=== Weighted

When we projected `myGraph`, we also projected the relationship property `weight`.
In order to tell the algorithm to consider this property as a relationship weight, we have to set the `relationshipWeightProperty` configuration parameter to `weight`.

[role=query-example]
--
.The following will run the algorithm on a graph with weighted relationships and stream results:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.labelPropagation.stream('myGraph', { relationshipWeightProperty: 'weight' })
YIELD nodeId, communityId AS Community
RETURN gds.util.asNode(nodeId).name AS Name, Community
ORDER BY Community, Name
----

.Results
[opts="header",cols="1,1"]
|===
| Name      | Community
| "Bridget" | 2
| "Michael" | 2
| "Alice"   | 4
| "Charles" | 4
| "Doug"    | 4
| "Mark"    | 4
|===
--

Compared to the xref:algorithms/label-propagation.adoc#algorithms-label-propagation-examples-stream[unweighted run] of the algorithm we still have two communities, but they contain two and four nodes respectively.
Using the weighted relationships, the nodes `Alice` and `Charles` are now in the same community as there is a strong link between them.

==== Weighted nodes

By specifying a node weight via the `nodeWeightProperty` key, we can also control the influence of a nodes community onto its neighbors.
During the computation of the weight of a specific community, the node property will be multiplied by the weight of that node's relationships.

[role=query-example]
--
.The following will run the algorithm on a graph with weighted nodes and stream results:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.labelPropagation.stream('myGraph', { nodeWeightProperty: 'posts' })
YIELD nodeId, communityId AS Community
RETURN gds.util.asNode(nodeId).name AS Name, Community
ORDER BY Community, Name
----

.Results
[opts="header",cols="1,1"]
|===
| Name      | Community
| "Alice"   | 4
| "Charles" | 4
| "Doug"    | 4
| "Mark"    | 4
| "Bridget" | 5
| "Michael" | 5
|===
--

NOTE: We have used the `stream` mode to demonstrate running the algorithm using weights, the configuration parameters are available for all the modes of the algorithm.

[[algorithms-label-propagation-examples-seeding]]
=== Seeded communities

At the beginning of the algorithm computation, every node is initialized with a unique label, and the labels propagate through the network.

An initial set of labels can be provided by setting the `seedProperty` configuration parameter.
When we projected `myGraph`, we also projected the node property `seed_label`.
We can use this node property as `seedProperty`.

The algorithm first checks if there is a seed label assigned to the node.
If no seed label is present, the algorithm assigns new unique label to the node.
Using this preliminary set of labels, it then sequentially updates each node's label to a new one, which is the most frequent label among its neighbors at every iteration of label propagation.

WARNING: The `consecutiveIds` configuration option cannot be used in combination with `seedProperty` in order to retain the seeding values.

[role=query-example]
--
.The following will run the algorithm with pre-defined labels:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.labelPropagation.stream('myGraph', { seedProperty: 'seed_label' })
YIELD nodeId, communityId AS Community
RETURN gds.util.asNode(nodeId).name AS Name, Community
ORDER BY Community, Name
----

.Results
[opts="header",cols="1,1"]
|===
| Name      | Community
| "Charles" | 19
| "Doug"    | 19
| "Mark"    | 19
| "Alice"   | 21
| "Bridget" | 21
| "Michael" | 21
|===
--

As we can see, the communities are based on the `seed_label` property, concretely `19` is from the node `Mark` and `21` from `Doug`.

NOTE: We have used the `stream` mode to demonstrate running the algorithm using `seedProperty`, this configuration parameter is available for all the modes of the algorithm.
