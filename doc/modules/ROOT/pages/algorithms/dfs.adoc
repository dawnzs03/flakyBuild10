[[algorithms-dfs-intro]]
== Introduction

The Depth First Search algorithm is a graph traversal that starts at a given node and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search.
A related algorithm is the Breath First Search algorithm, xref:algorithms/bfs.adoc[Breath First Search].
This algorithm can be preferred over Breath First Search for example if one wants to find a target node at a large distance and exploring a random path has decent probability of success.
There are multiple termination conditions supported for the traversal, based on either reaching one of several target nodes, reaching a maximum depth, exhausting a given budget of traversed relationship cost, or just traversing the whole graph.
The output of the procedure contains information about which nodes were visited and in what order.

== Examples

:graph-description:
:image-file: traverse-graph.svg
include::partial$/algorithms/shared/examples-intro.adoc[]

Consider the graph projected by the following Cypher statement:

[source, cypher, role=noplay setup-query]
----
CREATE
       (nA:Node {name: 'A'}),
       (nB:Node {name: 'B'}),
       (nC:Node {name: 'C'}),
       (nD:Node {name: 'D'}),
       (nE:Node {name: 'E'}),

       (nA)-[:REL]->(nB),
       (nA)-[:REL]->(nC),
       (nB)-[:REL]->(nE),
       (nC)-[:REL]->(nD)
----

.The following statement will project the graph and store it in the graph catalog.
[source, cypher, role=noplay graph-project-query]
----
CALL gds.graph.project('myGraph', 'Node', 'REL')
----

In the following examples we will demonstrate using the Depth First Search algorithm on this graph.


=== Memory Estimation

:mode: stream
include::partial$/algorithms/shared/examples-estimate-intro.adoc[]

[role=query-example]
--
.The following will estimate the memory requirements for running the algorithm in stream mode:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
MATCH (source:Node {name: 'A'})
CALL gds.dfs.stream.estimate('myGraph', {
  sourceNode: source
})
YIELD nodeCount, relationshipCount, bytesMin, bytesMax, requiredMemory
RETURN nodeCount, relationshipCount, bytesMin, bytesMax, requiredMemory
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| nodeCount | relationshipCount | bytesMin | bytesMax | requiredMemory
| 5         | 4                 | 352      | 352      | "352 Bytes"
|===

=== Stream

:!stream-details:
include::partial$/algorithms/shared/examples-stream-intro.adoc[]

[role=query-example, no-result=true]
--
.Running the Depth First Search algorithm:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
MATCH (source:Node{name:'A'})
CALL gds.dfs.stream('myGraph', {
  sourceNode: source
})
YIELD path
RETURN path
----
--

If we do not specify any of the options for early termination, the algorithm will traverse the entire graph:
In the image below we can see the traversal order of the nodes, marked by relationship type `NEXT`:

[role=query-example, no-result=true]
--
.Running the Depth First Search algorithm with target nodes:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
MATCH (a:Node{name:'A'}), (d:Node{name:'D'}), (e:Node{name:'E'})
WITH id(a) AS source, [id(d), id(e)] AS targetNodes
CALL gds.dfs.stream('myGraph', {
  sourceNode: source,
  targetNodes: targetNodes
})
YIELD path
RETURN path
----
--

If specifying nodes `D` and `E` as target nodes, not all nodes at distance 1 will be visited due to the depth first traversal order, in which node `D` is reached before `B`.

image::dfs-target-nodes-stream-path.svg[Visualization of Depth First Search stream with target nodes ,align="center"]


[role=query-example, no-result=true]
--
.Running the Depth First Search algorithm with maxDepth:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
MATCH (source:Node{name:'A'})
CALL gds.dfs.stream('myGraph', {
  sourceNode: source,
  maxDepth: 1
})
YIELD path
RETURN path
----
--

In the above case, nodes `D` and `E` were not visited since they are at distance 2 from node `A`.

=== Mutate

The `mutate` execution mode updates the named graph with new relationships.
The path returned from the Depth First Search algorithm is a line graph, where the nodes appear in the order they were visited by the algorithm.
The relationship type has to be configured using the `mutateRelationshipType` option.

The `mutate` mode is especially useful when multiple algorithms are used in conjunction.

For more details on the `mutate` mode in general, see xref:common-usage/running-algos.adoc#running-algos-mutate[Mutate].

Depth First Search `mutate` supports the same early termination conditions as the `stream` mode.

[role=query-example]
--
.The following will run the algorithm in `mutate` mode:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
MATCH (source:Node{name:'A'})
CALL gds.dfs.mutate('myGraph', {
  sourceNode: source,
  mutateRelationshipType: 'DFS'
})
YIELD relationshipsWritten
RETURN relationshipsWritten
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| relationshipsWritten
| 4
|===
--

After executing the above query, the in-memory graph will be updated with new relationships of type `DFS`.

[NOTE]
====
The relationships produced are always directed, even if the input graph is undirected.
