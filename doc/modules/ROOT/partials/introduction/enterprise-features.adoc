The Neo4j Graph Data Science library is available in two editions.
By default, GDS will operate as the Community Edition.
To unlock Enterprise Edition features, a valid Neo4j Graph Data Science Enterprise license file is required.
See xref:installation/installation-enterprise-edition.adoc[] for how to configure the license.
