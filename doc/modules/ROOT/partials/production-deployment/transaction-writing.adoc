= Transaction writing examples

[NOTE]
====
The code in this section is for illustrative purposes.
The goal is to demonstrate correct usage of the GDS library write functionality with Cypher Shell and Java API.

== Cypher Shell

Example for incorrect use.

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
:BEGIN

// Project a graph
MATCH (a:Artist)<-[:RELEASED_BY]-(:Album)-[:HAS_GENRE]->(g:Genre)
RETURN gds.graph.project('test', g, a, { relationshipType: 'IS_ASSOCIATED_WITH' });

// Delete the old stuff
MATCH ()-[r:SIMILAR_TO]->() DELETE r;

// Run the algorithm
CALL gds.nodeSimilarity.write(
  'test', {
    writeRelationshipType: 'SIMILAR_TO',
    writeProperty: 'score'
  }
);

:COMMIT
----

The issue with the above statement is that all the queries run in the same transaction.

A correct handling of the above statement would be to run each statement in its own transaction, which is shown below.
Notice the reordering of the statements, this ensures that the in-memory graph will have the most recent changes after the removal of the relationships.

First remove the unwanted relationships.

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
:BEGIN

MATCH ()-[r:SIMILAR_TO]->() DELETE r;

:COMMIT
----

Project a graph.

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
:BEGIN

MATCH (a:Artist)<-[:RELEASED_BY]-(:Album)-[:HAS_GENRE]->(g:Genre)
RETURN gds.graph.project('test', g, a, { relationshipType: 'IS_ASSOCIATED_WITH' });

:COMMIT
----

Run the algorithm.

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
:BEGIN

CALL gds.nodeSimilarity.write(
  'test', {
    writeRelationshipType: 'SIMILAR_TO',
    writeProperty: 'score'
  }
);

:COMMIT
----


== Java API

The same issue can be seen using the Java API, the examples are below.

.Constants used throughout the examples below:
[source, java]
----
// Removes the in-memory graph (if exists) from the graph catalog
static final String CYPHER_DROP_GDS_GRAPH_IF_EXISTS =
    "CALL gds.graph.drop('test', false)";

// Projects a graph
static final String CYPHER_PROJECT_GDS_GRAPH_ARTIST_GENRE =
    "MATCH (a:Artist)<-[:RELEASED_BY]-(:Album)-[:HAS_GENRE]->(g:Genre)" +
    "RETURN gds.graph.project(" +
    "  'test', g, a, { relationshipType: 'IS_ASSOCIATED_WITH' }" +
    ")";

// Runs NodeSimilarity in `write` mode over the in-memory graph
static final String CYPHER_WRITE_SIMILAR_TO =
    "CALL gds.nodeSimilarity.write(" +
    "   'test', {" +
    "       writeRelationshipType: 'SIMILAR_TO'," +
    "       writeProperty: 'score'"+
    "   }"
    ");";
----

.Incorrect use:
[source, java]
----
try (var session = driver.session()) {
	var params = Map.<String, Object>of("graphName", "genre-related-to-artist");
	session.writeTransaction(tx -> {
		tx.run(CYPHER_DROP_GDS_GRAPH_IF_EXISTS, params).consume();
		tx.run(CYPHER_PROJECT_GDS_GRAPH_ARTIST_GENRE, params).consume();
		tx.run("MATCH ()-[r:SIMILAR_TO]->() DELETE r").consume();
		return tx.run(CYPHER_WRITE_SIMILAR_TO, params).consume();
	});
}
----

Here we are facing the same issue with running everything in the same transaction.
This can be written correctly by splitting each statement in its own transaction.

.Correct handling of the statements:
[source, java]
----
try (var session = driver.session()) {

    // First run the remove statement
    session.writeTransaction(tx -> {
        return tx.run("MATCH ()-[r:SIMILAR_TO]->() DELETE r").consume();
    });

    // Project a graph
    var params = Map.<String, Object>of("graphName", "genre-related-to-artist");
	session.writeTransaction(tx -> {
	    tx.run(CYPHER_DROP_GDS_GRAPH_IF_EXISTS, params).consume();
	    return tx.run(CYPHER_PROJECT_GDS_GRAPH_ARTIST_GENRE, params).consume();
    });

	// Run the algorithm
    session.writeTransaction(tx -> {
        return tx.run(CYPHER_WRITE_SIMILAR_TO, params).consume();
    });
}
