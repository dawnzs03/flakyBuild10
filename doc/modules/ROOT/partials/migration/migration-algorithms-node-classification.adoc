= Node Classification

The original alpha version of node classification has been completely removed and incorporated into xref:machine-learning/node-property-prediction/nodeclassification-pipelines/node-classification.adoc[node classification pipelines].
Before training a node classification model, you must xref:machine-learning/node-property-prediction/nodeclassification-pipelines/config.adoc#nodeclassification-creating-a-pipeline[create] and configure a training pipeline.


== Train

Some parts of the training are now configured in specific configuration procedures for the training pipeline.
These must precede calling the `train` procedure in order to be effective.
The remaining parts are moved to the xref:machine-learning/node-property-prediction/nodeclassification-pipelines/training.adoc[pipeline train procedure].
Please see the table below.

.Changes in configuration for train
[options=header, cols=2]
|===
| 1.x
| 2.x
| `modelName`
| This parameter is now only configured in `gds.beta.pipeline.nodeClassification.train`.
| `featuresProperties`
| This parameter is replaced by `gds.beta.pipeline.nodeClassification.selectFeatures`. There is now also a procedure `gds.beta.pipeline.nodeClassification.addNodeProperty` to compute node properties for the input graph in the training pipeline and produced classification model.
| `targetProperty`
| This parameter is now only configured in `gds.beta.pipeline.nodeClassification.train`.
| `holdoutFraction`
| This parameter is now named `testFraction` and configured in `gds.beta.pipeline.nodeClassification.configureSplit`.
| `validationFolds`
| This parameter is now only configured in `gds.beta.pipeline.nodeClassification.configureSplit`.
| `metrics`
| This parameter is now only configured in `gds.beta.pipeline.nodeClassification.train`.
| `params`
| This parameter is replaced by `gds.beta.pipeline.nodeClassification.addLogisticRegression`, allowing configuration for a single model candidate. The procedure can be called several times to add several model candidates. There is also a new option for using random forest as a model candidate with `gds.beta.pipeline.nodeClassification.addRandomForest`.
| `randomSeed`
| This parameter is now only configured in `gds.beta.pipeline.nodeClassification.train`.
|===

.Changes in configuration for the pipeline
[options=header, cols=2]
|===
| 1.x | 2.x
| `gds.beta.pipeline.nodeClassification.configureParams`
| | This procedure, which is no longer present, added logistic regression model candidates. Adding logistic regression candidates, can instead be done by calling `gds.beta.pipeline.nodeClassification.addLogisticRegression` one or multiple times.

== Predict

Apart from the parameters listed below, the API for node classification prediction is the same as before but with different procedures.
These procedures are `gds.beta.pipeline.nodeClassification.predict.[mutate,stream,write]`.

.Changes in configuration for predict
[options=header, cols=2]
|===
| 1.x
| 2.x
| `batchSize`
| Batch size is optimized internally and no longer user-configurable.
|===

.Prediction procedure replacements:
[options=header, cols="m,m"]
|===
| 1.x
| 2.x
| gds.alpha.ml.nodeClassification.predict.stream
| gds.beta.pipeline.nodeClassification.predict.stream
| gds.alpha.ml.nodeClassification.predict.mutate
| gds.beta.pipeline.nodeClassification.predict.mutate
| gds.alpha.ml.nodeClassification.predict.write
| gds.beta.pipeline.nodeClassification.predict.write
|===
