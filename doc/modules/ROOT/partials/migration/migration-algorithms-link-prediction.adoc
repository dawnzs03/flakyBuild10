= Link Prediction

The original alpha version of link prediction has been completely removed and incorporated into xref:machine-learning/linkprediction-pipelines/link-prediction.adoc[link prediction pipelines].
Before training a link prediction model, you must xref:machine-learning/linkprediction-pipelines/config.adoc#linkprediction-creating-a-pipeline[create] and configure a training pipeline.


== Train

Some parts of the training are now configured in specific configuration procedures for the training pipeline.
These must precede calling the `train` procedure in order to be effective.
The remaining parts are moved to the xref:machine-learning/linkprediction-pipelines/training.adoc[pipeline train procedure].
Please see the table below.

.Changes in configuration for train
[options=header, cols=2]
|===
| 1.x
| 2.x
| `modelName`
| This parameter is now only configured in `gds.beta.pipeline.linkPrediction.train`.
| `featuresProperties`
| Replaced by `nodeProperties` in `gds.beta.pipeline.linkPrediction.addFeature`.
There is also a procedure `gds.beta.pipeline.linkPrediction.addNodeProperty` to compute node properties for the input graph in the training pipeline and produced classification model.
| `linkFeatureCombiner`
| Replaced by the second positional argument to `gds.beta.pipeline.linkPrediction.addFeature`, called `featureType`.
| `trainRelationshipType` and `testRelationshipType`
| These parameters are removed. Use `gds.beta.pipeline.linkPrediction.configureSplit` to set up the dataset split.
| `validationFolds`
| This parameter is now only configured in `gds.beta.pipeline.linkPrediction.configureSplit`.
| `negativeClassWeight`
| This parameter is now only configured in `gds.beta.pipeline.linkPrediction.train`.
| `params`
| This parameter is replaced by `gds.beta.pipeline.linkPrediction.addLogisticRegression`, allowing configuration for a single model candidate. The procedure can be called several times to add several model candidates. There is also a new option for using random forest as a model candidate with `gds.beta.pipeline.linkPrediction.addRandomForest`.
| `randomSeed`
| This parameter is now only configured in `gds.beta.pipeline.linkPrediction.train`.
|===

.Changes in configuration for the pipeline
[options=header, cols=2]
|===
| 1.x | 2.x
| `gds.beta.pipeline.linkPrediction.configureParams`
| This procedure, which is no longer present, added logistic regression model candidates. Adding logistic regression candidates, can instead be done by calling `gds.beta.pipeline.linkPrediction.addLogisticRegression` one or multiple times.

== Predict

The API for link prediction classification is the same as before, but with different procedures.
These procedures are `gds.beta.pipeline.linkPrediction.predict.[mutate,stream]`.
However, there's no longer a `write` mode for link prediction classification, but it's still possible to emulate this behavior using the `mutate` mode followed by `gds.graph.relationship.write`.

.Prediction procedure replacements:
[options=header, cols="m,m"]

| 1.x
| 2.x
| gds.alpha.ml.linkPrediction.predict.stream
| gds.beta.pipeline.linkPrediction.predict.stream
| gds.alpha.ml.linkPrediction.predict.mutate
| gds.beta.pipeline.linkPrediction.predict.mutate
| gds.alpha.ml.linkPrediction.predict.write
