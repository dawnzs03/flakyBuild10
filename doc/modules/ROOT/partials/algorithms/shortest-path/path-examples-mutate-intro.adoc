The `mutate` execution mode updates the named graph with new relationships.
Each new relationship represents a path from source node to target node.
The relationship type is configured using the `mutateRelationshipType` option.
The total path cost is stored using the `totalCost` property.

The `mutate` mode is especially useful when multiple algorithms are used in conjunction.

For more details on the `mutate` mode in general, see xref:common-usage/running-algos.adoc#running-algos-mutate[Mutate].
