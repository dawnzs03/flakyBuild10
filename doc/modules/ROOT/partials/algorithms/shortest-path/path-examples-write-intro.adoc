The `write` execution mode updates the Neo4j database with new relationships.
Each new relationship represents a path from source node to target node.
The relationship type is configured using the `writeRelationshipType` option.
The total path cost is stored using the `totalCost` property.
The intermediate node ids are stored using the `nodeIds` property.
The accumulated costs to reach an intermediate node are stored using the `costs` property.


For more details on the `write` mode in general, see xref:common-usage/running-algos.adoc#running-algos-write[Write].
