[glossary]
[[directed]]Directed:: xref:introduction.adoc#introduction-algorithms-directed[Directed trait]. The algorithm is well-defined on a directed graph.

[[directed-allowed]]Directed:: xref:introduction.adoc#introduction-algorithms-directed[Directed trait]. The algorithm ignores the direction of the graph.

[[directed-unsupported]]Directed:: xref:introduction.adoc#introduction-algorithms-directed[Directed trait]. The algorithm does not run on a directed graph.

[[undirected]]Undirected:: xref:introduction.adoc#introduction-algorithms-undirected[Undirected trait]. The algorithm is well-defined on an undirected graph.

[[undirected-allowed]]Undirected:: xref:introduction.adoc#introduction-algorithms-undirected[Undirected trait]. The algorithm ignores the undirectedness of the graph.

[[heterogeneous-nodes]]Heterogeneous nodes:: xref:introduction.adoc#introduction-algorithms-heterogeneous-nodes[Heterogeneous nodes] fully supported. The algorithm has the ability to distinguish between nodes of different types.

[[heterogeneous-nodes-allowed]]Heterogeneous nodes:: xref:introduction.adoc#introduction-algorithms-heterogeneous-nodes[Heterogeneous nodes] allowed. The algorithm treats all selected nodes similarly regardless of their label.

[[heterogeneous-rels]]Heterogeneous relationships:: xref:introduction.adoc#introduction-algorithms-heterogeneous-rels[Heterogeneous relationships] fully supported. The algorithm has the ability to distinguish between relationships of different types.

[[heterogeneous-rels-allowed]]Heterogeneous relationships:: xref:introduction.adoc#introduction-algorithms-heterogeneous-rels[Heterogeneous relationships] allowed. The algorithm treats all selected relationships similarly regardless of their type.

[[weighted]]Weighted relationships:: xref:introduction.adoc#introduction-algorithms-weighted[Weighted trait]. The algorithm supports a relationship property to be used as weight, specified via the xref:common-usage/running-algos.adoc#common-configuration-relationship-weight-property[_relationshipWeightProperty_] configuration parameter.

[[weighted-allowed]]Weighted relationships:: xref:introduction.adoc#introduction-algorithms-weighted[Weighted trait]. The algorithm treats each relationship as equally important, discarding the value of any relationship weight.
