In the `stats` execution mode, the algorithm returns a single row containing a summary of the algorithm result.
ifdef::stats-details[]
{stats-details}
endif::[]
This execution mode does not have any side effects.
It can be useful for evaluating algorithm performance by inspecting the `computeMillis` return item.
In the examples below we will omit returning the timings.
The full signature of the procedure can be found in <<{stats-syntax}, the syntax section>>.

For more details on the `stats` mode in general, see xref:common-usage/running-algos.adoc#running-algos-stats[Stats].
