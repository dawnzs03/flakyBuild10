The `mutate` execution mode extends the `stats` mode with an important side effect: updating the named graph with a new {entity} property containing the {result} for that {entity}.
The name of the new property is specified using the mandatory configuration parameter `mutateProperty`.
The result is a single summary row, similar to `stats`, but with some additional metrics.
The `mutate` mode is especially useful when multiple algorithms are used in conjunction.
