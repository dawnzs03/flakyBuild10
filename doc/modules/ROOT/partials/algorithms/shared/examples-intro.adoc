In this section we will show examples of running the {algorithm-name} algorithm on a concrete graph.
The intention is to illustrate what the results look like and to provide a guide in how to make use of the algorithm in a real setting.
We will do this on a small {graph-description} graph of a handful nodes connected in a particular pattern.
The example graph looks like this:
