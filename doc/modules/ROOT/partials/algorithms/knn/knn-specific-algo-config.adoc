| Name                                                             | Type            | Default   | Optional | Description
| nodeProperties                                                   | String or Map or List of Strings / Maps  | n/a       | no
| The node properties to use for similarity computation along with their selected similarity metrics.
Accepts a single property key,
a Map of property keys to metrics,
or a List of property keys and/or Maps, as above.
See xref:algorithms/knn.adoc#algorithms-knn-node-properties-configuration[Node properties and metrics configuration] for details.
| topK                                                             | Integer         | 10        | yes      | The number of neighbors to find for each node.
The K-nearest neighbors are returned.
This value cannot be lower than 1.
| sampleRate                                                       | Float           | 0.5       | yes      | Sample rate to limit the number of comparisons per node.
Value must be between 0 (exclusive) and 1 (inclusive).
| deltaThreshold                                                   | Float           | 0.001     | yes      | Value as a percentage to determine when to stop early.
If fewer updates than the configured value happen, the algorithm stops.
Value must be between 0 (exclusive) and 1 (inclusive).
| xref:common-usage/running-algos.adoc#common-configuration-max-iterations[maxIterations]            | Integer         | 100       | yes      | Hard limit to stop the algorithm after that many iterations.
| randomJoins                                                      | Integer         | 10        | yes      | The number of random attempts per node to connect new node neighbors based on random selection, for each iteration.
| xref:algorithms/knn.adoc#algorithms-knn-introduction-sampling[initialSampler]         | String          | "uniform" | yes      | The method used to sample the first `k` random neighbors for each node. "uniform" and "randomWalk", both case-insensitive, are valid inputs.
| randomSeed                                                       | Integer         | n/a       | yes      | The seed value to control the randomness of the algorithm.
Note that `concurrency` must be set to 1 when setting this parameter.
| similarityCutoff                                                 | Float           | 0         | yes      | Filter out from the list of K-nearest neighbors nodes with similarity below this threshold.
| perturbationRate                                                 | Float           | 0         | yes      | The probability of replacing the least similar known neighbor with an encountered neighbor of equal similarity.
