| xref:common-usage/running-algos.adoc#common-configuration-relationship-weight-property[relationshipWeightProperty] | String   | null    | yes      | Name of the relationship property to use as weights. If unspecified, the algorithm runs unweighted.
| xref:common-usage/running-algos.adoc#common-configuration-seed-property[seedProperty]                              | String   | n/a     | yes      | Used to set the initial community for a node. The property value needs to be a non-negative number.
| maxLevels                                                                        | Integer  | 10      | yes      | The maximum number of levels in which the graph is clustered and then condensed.
| xref:common-usage/running-algos.adoc#common-configuration-max-iterations[maxIterations]                            | Integer  | 10      | yes      | The maximum number of iterations that the modularity optimization will run for each level.
| xref:common-usage/running-algos.adoc#common-configuration-tolerance[tolerance]                                     | Float    | 0.0001  | yes      | Minimum change in modularity between iterations. If the modularity changes less than the tolerance value, the result is considered stable and the algorithm returns.
| includeIntermediateCommunities                                                   | Boolean  | false   | yes      | Indicates whether to write intermediate communities. If set to false, only the final community is persisted.
| consecutiveIds                                                                   | Boolean  | false   | yes      | Flag to decide whether component identifiers are mapped into a consecutive id space (requires additional memory). Cannot be used in combination with the `includeIntermediateCommunities` flag.
