| xref:common-usage/running-algos.adoc#common-configuration-tolerance[tolerance]                                     | Float                    | 0.0000001 | yes      | Minimum change in scores between iterations. If all scores change less than the tolerance value the result is considered stable and the algorithm returns.

Supported values are `None`, `MinMax`, `Max`, `Mean`, `Log`, and `StdScore`.  To apply scaler-specific configuration, use the Map syntax: `{scaler: 'name', ...}`.
