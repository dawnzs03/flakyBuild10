| iterations                                                                       | Integer         | n/a             | no        | The number of iterations to run HashGNN. Must be at least 1.
| embeddingDensity                                                                 | Integer         | n/a             | no        | The number of features to sample per node in each iteration. Called `K` in the original paper. Must be at least 1.
| heterogeneous                                                                    | Boolean         | false           | yes       | Whether different relationship types should be treated differently.
| neighborInfluence                                                                | Float           | 1.0             | yes       | Controls how often neighbors' features are sampled in each iteration relative to sampling the node's own features. Must be non-negative.
| binarizeFeatures                                                                 | Map             | n/a             | yes       | A map with keys `dimension` and `threshold`. If given, features are transformed into `dimension` binary features via hyperplane rounding. Increasing `threshold` makes the output more sparse, and it defaults to `0`. The value of `dimension` must be at least 1.
| generateFeatures                                                                 | Map             | n/a             | yes       | A map with keys `dimension` and `densityLevel`. Should be given if and only if `featureProperties` is empty. If given, `dimension` binary features are generated with approximately `densityLevel` active features per node. Both must be at least 1 and `densityLevel` at most `dimension`.
| outputDimension                                                                  | Integer         | n/a             | yes       | If given, the embeddings are projected randomly into `outputDimension` dense features. Must be at least 1.
| randomSeed                                                                       | Integer         | n/a             | yes       | A random seed which is used for all randomness in computing the embeddings.
