| featureProperties                                                                | List of String  | []              | yes       | The names of the node properties that should be used as input features. All property names must exist in the projected graph and be of type Float or List of Float.
| embeddingDimension                                                               | Integer         | n/a             | no        | The dimension of the computed node embeddings. Minimum value is 1.

5+| The number of iterations is equal to the length of `iterationWeights`.
5+| It is required that `iterationWeights` is non-empty or `nodeSelfInfluence` is non-zero.
