| xref:common-usage/running-algos.adoc#common-configuration-relationship-weight-property[relationshipWeightProperty]  | String  | null    | yes      | Name of the relationship property to use as weights to influence the probabilities of the random walks. The weights need to be >= 0. If unspecified, the algorithm runs unweighted.

| negativeSamplingExponent                                                          | Float   | 0.75       | yes      | Exponent applied to the node frequency to obtain the negative sampling distribution. A value of 1.0 samples proportionally to the frequency. A value of 0.0 samples each node equally.
| embeddingDimension                                                                | Integer | 128        | yes      | Size of the computed node embeddings.
