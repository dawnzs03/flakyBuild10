If set to 1, all possible links are considered, i.e., xref:machine-learning/linkprediction-pipelines/predict.adoc#algorithms-link-prediction-pipelines-predict-exhaustive-search[exhaustive-search]. Otherwise, an xref:machine-learning/linkprediction-pipelines/predict.adoc#algorithms-link-prediction-pipelines-predict-approximate-search[approximate search strategy] will be used. Value must be between 0 (exclusive) and 1 (inclusive).

| xref:algorithms/knn.adoc#algorithms-knn-introduction-sampling[initialSampler] footnote:approx[] | String  | "uniform" | yes      | The method used to sample the first `k` random neighbors for each node. "uniform" and "randomWalk", both case-insensitive, are valid inputs.
