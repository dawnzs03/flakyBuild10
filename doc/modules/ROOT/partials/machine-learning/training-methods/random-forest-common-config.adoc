| Name                    | Type                                 | Default                     | Optional | Description
| maxFeaturesRatio        | Float or Map footnote:range[A map should be of the form `{range: [minValue, maxValue]}`. It is used by auto-tuning.]
                                                                 | `1 / sqrt(\|features\|)`    | yes      | The ratio of features to consider when looking for the best split
| numberOfSamplesRatio    | Float or Map footnote:range[]        | 1.0                         | yes      | The ratio of samples to consider per decision tree. We use sampling with replacement. A value of `0` indicates using every training example (no sampling).
| numberOfDecisionTrees   | Integer or Map footnote:range[]      | 100                         | yes      | The number of decision trees.
| maxDepth                | Integer or Map footnote:range[]      | No max depth                | yes      | The maximum depth of a decision tree.
| minLeafSize             | Integer or Map footnote:range[]      | 1                           | yes      | The minimum number of samples for a leaf node in a decision tree. Must be strictly smaller than `minSplitSize`.
| minSplitSize            | Integer or Map footnote:range[]      | 2                           | yes      | The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node in a decision tree. Must be strictly larger than `minLeafSize`.
