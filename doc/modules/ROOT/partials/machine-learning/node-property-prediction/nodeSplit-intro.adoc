Node {pipeline-type} Pipelines manage the splitting of nodes into several sets, which are used for training, testing and validating the model candidates defined in the <<{parameterspace-link},parameter space>>.
Configuring the splitting is optional, and if omitted, splitting will be done using default settings.
The splitting configuration of a pipeline can be inspected by using `gds.beta.model.list` and yielding `splitConfig`.

The node splits are used in the training process as follows:

. The input graph is split into two parts: the train graph and the test graph. See the xref:machine-learning/node-property-prediction/noderegression-pipelines/config.adoc#node-pipelines-configure-splits-train-test-image[example below].
. The train graph is further divided into a number of validation folds, each consisting of a train part and a validation part. See the xref:machine-learning/node-property-prediction/noderegression-pipelines/config.adoc#node-pipelines-configure-splits-validation-image[animation below].
. Each model candidate is trained on each train part and evaluated on the respective validation part.
. The model with the highest average score according to the primary metric will win the training.
. The winning model will then be retrained on the entire train graph.
. The winning model is evaluated on the train graph as well as the test graph.
. The winning model is retrained on the entire original graph.

Below we illustrate an example for a graph with 12 nodes.
First we use a `holdoutFraction` of 0.25 to split into train and test subgraphs.

Then we carry out three validation folds, where we first split the train subgraph into 3 disjoint subsets (s1, s2 and s3), and then alternate which subset is used for validation. 
For each fold, all candidate models are trained using the red nodes, and validated using the green nodes.
