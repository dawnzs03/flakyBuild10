     * We assume database ids are unique to a JVM.
     * Therefore, we can have this JVM-wide singleton holding a map of database id to task store.
     * <p>
     * This is of course abominable and should be gotten rid of.
     * And we can get rid of it once all tests are not using context-injected task stores anymore.
     * We want to do that migration in vertical slices, so we can have this solution in place temporarily.
     * Procedure facade will use this service class and be oblivious to the underlying abomination.
     * And TaskRegistryExtension will be made to hand out references using database id.
     * We rely on database ids being unique for the lifetime of a JVM.
     * <p>
     * Note that TaskRegistryExtension will thus serve both tests and prod,
     * until we can eliminate usages of its products, and in turn eliminate it completely.
