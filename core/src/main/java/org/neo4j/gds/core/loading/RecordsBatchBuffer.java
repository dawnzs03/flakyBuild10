     * There are two scenarios that can happen while consuming a batch of records from the
     * kernel. If we read in fixed-size batches, these batches usually align with the
     * buffer size and once we consumed the whole batch, the buffers can be flushed to
     * the importer tasks. In the second scenario, we read from partitioned index scans
     * which have varying sizes for partitions that might also exceed the size of the buffer.
     * In that scenario, we need to flush the buffer <b>before</b> we advance to the next
     * batch. The two scenarios are indicated by the returned {@code ScanState}.
     *
     * @param cursor           A wrapper around a {@link org.neo4j.internal.kernel.api.Cursor} that allows
     *                         us to consume the entity records using this buffer instance.
     * @param reserveNextBatch Indicates if the underlying kernel scan should advance the cursor to
     *                         the next batch. This needs to be set to false, if the {@code RecordsBatchBuffer}
     *                         has not read the complete batch yet, but had to be flushed before that.
     * @return a {@code ScanState} that indicates if the consumer needs to be flushed and
     *     if another batch can be read from the underlying scan.
